__label__positive POWER ROBERT Americans Mars Europeans Venus apart simply raising line Robert Kagan author Paradise Power not only caught attention many managed stir wave discussions among politicians elites concerned cross Atlantic relations Kagan thought provoking book became extremely popular received international acclaim analysis deteriorating Europe relationship not mention catchy striking phrases systematically introduced throughout slender yet captivating book Kagan introduces multiple chapters book order deconstruct key underlying issues claims causes ever widening divide Europe chapter Power Gap Kagan starts World War understand Europe displays towards military wars argues World Wars weakened Europe tremendously helped emerge super power elaborates might chapter follows Psychologies Power Weakness Kagan explains lack power not only affect ideologies change perspectives well claims Europe military power compels not only tolerate threats ignore together time try counterbalance force constructing world governed economic soft non violent methods chapter culminates chapter Kagan discusses intricate details Kosovo Bosnia highlighting Europe failure America effectiveness handling situation finally presents central argument chapters Post Modern Paradise World America Made Kagan states Europe evolution present state occurred mantle security guarantee could not occurred without Casting doubts Europe intentions Kagan centers argument growing self centered policies Europe questions validity cohesive terms west chapter Still West Finally seems Kagan provides solution problem Europe divide concluding chapter Adjusting Hegemony simply stating one line task Europeans Americans new reality American hegemony extremely small book compared issue addresses needs analysis close many issues addressed Kagan brief analysis one might not completely satisfied certain claims reasonings manner grave sensitive topic handled tone underlying bias contrast general opinion well balanced view author holds Kagan manages miss crucial facts figures not mention present stark paradoxes essay lacks sufficient start let point contradictions Kagan arguments presence highly undermines claims leaving reader dilemma either argument Kagan claims Europe relative weakness understandably produced powerful European interest building world military strength hard power matter less economic soft power rules behavior goes say Since Europeans lack capacity military actions either individually collectively Europe natural oppose allowing others cannot contrast Europe today wealth technological capability make world power military terms Europe wanted become kind world power Kagan contradicts views stating many times Europe weak nor capacity build forces yet time puts forth argument Europe capabilities increasing defense spending military might match chapter Psychologies Power Weakness Kagan one claim contradicts another made next chapter reasoning claims seem absolutely first explains Europe greater tolerance threats due weakness fearful past suffered explains giving example man knife one rifle different interpretations word threat confronting bear Kagan feels Europe become military power wishes says could easily spend twice much currently spending defense believed necessary forces ask question would one bear one could produce rifle prevent misfortune quite possible Europeans feel safe not enjoy free ride gotten American security umbrella past six decades rather real threat use phrases Axis Evil Rouge States Kagan uses describe Iraq Iran not mention references Mass Destruction uses pretext war Iraq still seem elusive reason seems blatantly ignoring creation Kagan maintains Iraq threat perceived one Europe not might want explain Kagan Director Project New American Century signed document justifies American occupation Middle East irrespective threats Iraq Iran United States decades sought play permanent role Gulf regional security unresolved conflict Iraq provides immediate justification need substantial American force presence Gulf transcends issue regime Saddam Hussein American perspective value bases would endure even Saddam pass scene long term Iran may well prove large threat interests Gulf Iraq even Iranian relations improve retaining forward based forces region would still essential element security strategy given American interests region Rebuilding America forces conclude either author resorted cherry picking evidence suffers selective reasoning analysis analogies seem explaining military action one cannot justify saying hammer problems start look like nails author speaks nation willingness war simply ability capacity Without discussing need providing concrete reasons use aggression author seems content justifying use force simply one One important aspect Kagan leaves analysis political economical aspects ongoing Europe feud discussed economical aspects later review one must note Kagan not mention Protocol apart Clinton negotiation withdrawal Protocol created serious problems two giants www climnet org many issues growing fire disagreements Anti Missile example Kagan conveniently carpet needed addressed one discussing transatlantic relations www bbcnews com book covers issues pre World War decade occasionally going back ancient philosophy present issues citations many simply extended explanations examples see supra notes seem low especially absence important ones not mention certain citations wrongly historical facts Kagan mentions Europeans put real division labor consisted United States making dinner Europeans dishes yet not refer source cynical statement says vast majority Europeans always believed threat posed Saddam tolerable risk removing along alleging statements like Saddam Hussein Iraq precisely Europe sought gives source origin beliefs Strangely supports one claims stating supra note matter also view commonly found American textbooks One might not generally expect see evidence scholarly analysis transatlantic relations Kagan times jumps back times injected strong philosophies essay mentions number times Americans see world perspective Europeans followers policies Kagan seems overlooked fact though Hobbes described state nature only reason Hobbes justifies sovereignty ensure peace earth Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes Hobbes theory flawed later philosophers Hobbes justify American aggression Hobbes theory aggression justified sovereign conclusions Kagan draws seem beliefs American idealist living world politics pure religion concludes providing free security Europe Cold War America great power willingness assume responsibility protecting nations given Europe opportunity build economically Kagan asserts point says Given America willingness spend much money protecting Europeans would rather spend money social welfare programs long vacations shorter inaccurate presentations facts subjective bias ideologies would like put forth two points order accentuate fallacy two statements First America interest Europe not provide security whether Cold War One must not confuse fact measures taken Soviet advance purely selfish motives rather benefit nations eye communist empire Kagan acknowledges fact says check Soviet power removed United States free practically whenever wherever chose Second Kagan acknowledges Europe economy comfortable position support welfare programs along increased military spending attributing fact Europe spends welfare calls free results faulty analysis mentioned earlier Kagan chose omit ignore certain facts example Balkans author cited many times book would seem relevant Kosovo one primary issues discusses bring forth European American involvement Kosovo Bosnia not based calculations narrow American national interest Americans compelling moral interest stopping genocide ethnic cleansing national interest stake Balkans Kagan sees Indeed stopping genocide concern only concern Milosevic much agreed station NATO troops Kosovo stop conflicts none seem interested offer rather wanted complete access control Yugoslavia Group added Appendix last day conference held Paris one must note primary reason rejecting NATO troops demanded Yugoslavia surrender sovereignty Yet not mention Milosevic agreeing station NATO troops Kosovo http wsws org thing missing Kagan entire book words Latin America Africa seen Kagan believes America spending money protecting Europe Europe alone threats around world Cold War baffles quite extent not Kagan mention American Latin America official not Africa Far East matter well aware world around aware America support corrupt regimes throughout Latin America far East example self serving purposes alone author implying Latin American African countries threat Europe hence mention complete timeline Steven found multiple sites one severe defect put undermines entire argument book Kagan vision approach refers word power only terms military strength capabilities ultimately results false stumbling stone thesis Kagan believes world particular Europe left two options either follow audience reason reaches conclusion previously put due view Rather viewing tied threads says Kagan American leaders realize hardly constrained Europe not really capable reinforces claim throughout book see etc author abysmal ignorance hard hitting highly valid relevant facts rendered severe blows validity claims Kagan committed serious errors ignoring Europe strength not military political economical indeed population CIA Fact Book still growing leave aside Europe cannot simply overlooked brushed aside dead competitor culture Europe economically strong enough trouble wants recent problems genetically altered meat banana dispute steel industry debacle Boeing clash many proved Europe economic strength much concern must point rank deletion believe single factor capable arguing Kagan thesis arguments American Economy Not mentioned deteriorating state American economy even though problems exist wrote book seems ignorant persists America sustain exorbitant defense spending sustain current military spending levels current global dominance far future Strangely growing inflation rate rising unemployment stagflation trends economy showing heading towards recession believe dismissed myths author statistics see www bbcnews com http wsws org Also Kagan final solution suggest obvious answer Europe build military even only marginally leaves Kagan Europe military wants begin new arms race time Cold War Kagan must understand writing book international not simply whose ideologies Hence doubt would disagree world get arms race know stopping evil starts already discussed effects trade economics Kagan ignores Europe relation something must point end review Kagan rather conveniently topic transatlantic relationships justifying hegemony neo conservative fashion Americans would probably not agree Kagan ideology public opinion faith see various news sources leave aside Europeans rest world Kagan writes almost pages justify rather disappointing conclusion book thinks only solution ever widening divide Adjusting Hegemony Kagan says many statistics seem abandon Americans believe advancing interest advance interest humanity sounds drive point home quotes Benjamin Franklin saying America cause cause mankind must bring author notice recipient remarks international audience diverse culture heritage religious beliefs ideologies reason believe culture beliefs inferior author must realize transatlantic relationships not primary grade bully discussed seems take pride saying America alone attitude not abide Security Council takes action unilaterally irrespective international laws justified adopting double standards fails fathom gravity current day rather day wrote book situation growing American foreign policy around world sees Europe obstacle path America goals neutral observer would justified pointing may progress efforts establish world respects international laws human rights collective public opinion peace fails give not complete solution rid world weakly concludes essay saying little common understanding still long way many nothing words praise one line summary Francis Fukuyama calls Brilliant architect Rebuilding America Defense Project according Henry Kissinger innumerable charges human right violations ironically Kagan terms quintessential realist See http wikipedia org cases http www thenation com list crimes book seminal treatise would shape Europe relation discussion years come not particularly
