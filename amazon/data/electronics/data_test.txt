I just got these at a local store and they just really blow!!! I was swayed by the brand name and the great price (although higher than Amazon). It's true when they say you get what you pay for... rock-bottom price = rock-bottom performance. Terrible to say the least. Mine are going back right now. 
After having used CRTs roughly the size of small cars for my entire life, I finally jumped on the LCD-flatscreen bandwagon. This Acer 19" LCD makes me happy I did! Mostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color, brightness, and size of the screen really matters to me. This monitor really nails all three of those areas. It provides vivid, crisp colors; it doesn't wash out the picture with super-brightness (what my old monitor did), nor is its display too dark to catch the action; and the 19" screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size 
My setup: - Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip) - Win XP Pro - D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna) - Enabled the WEP feature I unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in. Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing. Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn't 'see' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card. This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers. The CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date. I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I've never had a problem with D-Link's website (or customer service, while we're on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link's site. Either way... install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates. Be sure to enable the encryption feature. If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can't go snooping through your stuff. Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information. I've had no problems with my current set-up. I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up-to-date 
I bought this unit on a wim. I was leaving for a business trip and needed a GPS. I really like it and it worked well for me. Unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery. So I returned it for another one. It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem. Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units. When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn't work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up. Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn't have any more units that I could exchange it for. So I called customer service and got an RAN. I am hoping when I get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that I don't have any more problems 
I bought this monitor in June 2006 and at first was quite pleased with the nice display. Less than 6 months later, in November 2006, I heard a strange noise while using the monitor and all of the sudden the screen went very bright -- like an overexposed photo. I'm currently working with Viewsonic to get it repaired (I must mail it to CA to be repaired, postage must be paid by me). All in all a disappointment and a hassle. Next time I'll buy a name brand 
These headphones are lightweight, fairly comfortable, and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of $20 headphones I've ever heard. Here are the aspects people always want to know about: BASS: these don't pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I've heard. You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration. MIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones. Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical. The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I'd never heard before on that song. In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones. These obviously can't play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good. I don't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100. And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money. I should go work for these guys or something =) 
It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue). 
I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano. It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit. Has anyone experienced this with theirs? My first generation nano does not experience this noise. I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement. Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective. Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself 
If you have problems with your flash drive ( like I did) don't count on any technical support. Lines are all automated and wait is always over 20 minutes for live support. Not to mention that it disconects you when it is done telling you this. PNY tech support is a joke 
Yeah, so apparently this was a really good PDA to buy. I BOUGHT THIS THREE YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS! Ive been searching for a new PDA since I thought this one was so out of date, and when reading all the reviews I came across many new "state of the art" PDAs that broke after only a few months. This baby has been great to me for three long years, so if you are looking for a reliable buy, go for this. Definately NOT flashy, very basic. All I use it for is appointments, dates, and to-dos. GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO USE A PDA AS AN AGENDA! Good luck on your PDA search! 
I bought one of these to replace the standard 32MB card that came with my camera. Wow, now I can store a ton of pictures. The price on the EP Memory cards are awesome too 
I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins. Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway. Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion. If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway. There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore 
I did a lot of research and finally ended up with this product. 1) BOSE is an excellent piece - but main drawbacks - portability and lack of audio input from other devices 2) Altec Lansing - basically a roun cylinder shaped one and I didnt get that in a black color for my 30 GB Black Video Ipod and the sound wasnt that impressive as Bose (or for that matter Logitech mm 50) 3) Apple's ipod Dock - its a bulky one, that is definitely not portable and costlier than the Bose. I went to BestBuy to listen to everything and Logitech mm 50 really outweighs the other ones on these - price, portability and sound quality, yea, its not like Bose or Apple's dock - but really good for such a small piece. The only thing I find a little difficult is, I am not able to switch playlists with the remote, its just for play/pause/next/prev and sounds, would've been completely happy if had all that I could do in the ipod. But, I am very happy with the buy and will definitely recommend to bu 
I hope it's live because if it's memorex, it's crap! that's my latest opinion after using this product. I have a LiteOn SOHW-802S and it hates Memorex. I rarely get a decent burn. More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it. My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together. So disappointing! Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate! [... 
Unit works about as expected, with possible exception of a few areas of the screen that are not too sensitive to the touches from the stylus. So far I am working around that. This is my 3rd Deluxe and the 1st one to give any operational problem of any sort. Generally a good product 
Unlike many other cables that splice A/V output, this cable does so while retaining the details of that output. I.e., both Left and Right channels are extracted and outputted, not simply the Left channel with audio mixed down to mono. Also, it works on some computers, too! On the minus side, I haven't gotten it to work on the television. In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player. I bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too. For that, it was worth the cost 
I think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables. I wouldn't spend money on the expensive ones. First of all, I'm not a cable junkie nor an expert. However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones. The durability of the cables... I don't know. But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter. Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant. Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones. I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85. Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same. Don't buy the expensive ones 
I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous. I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so! I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move. Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though. Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun 
A sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop. I took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the Kensington Contour. I didn't want to buy a Kensington. I wanted a backpack making company with a name I knew, like Jansport,or Kelty. I've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products. I settled on the Kensington because it had the qualities I was seeking: comfort, quality materials and design, water proofing, laptop padding, urban black, rugged exterior, sophisticated appearance, lots of pockets, adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket. I write and work in media for a living. Mostly I work at home, but once a week I travel to cities. This pack does exactly what I want it to do - have places for everything I need, protect my precious laptop, and look hip. So now it is a few months later. I still like my pack, but twice now the hardware has broken. The first time it was just the zipper-handle on the little outside pocket. It fell off. Kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free. Last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap-- broke when slung the pack across my back. I haven't contacted them yet 
I have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don't let me down 
I have a Canon S2 and these batteries last almost as long as the cheap costco non-rechargable ones. They do take upto 8 hours to charge and Amazon is correct about that. Does anyone know of good long lasting 2500 Mah rechargable batteries? 
I had a very poor experience with the Microsoft Media Center infrared keyboard and I wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would - I thought - get rid of all connection problems. I was wrong. The hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections. AS usual, I was very careful: I always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product - I don't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason: the package doesn't come cheap... I am a software developer - I have half a dozen computers at home - and I did everything as instructed. I found the software to be very average in terms of usability (why do they try to do all these fancy effects??), but that's not very important when it works fine. Unfortunately, after just a couple of days, the keyboard stopped working. I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer (both step were required - the on/off switch didn't work - same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective). Now, the mouse keeps on dropping connections. After a couple of hours of inactivity, the mouse simply stops responding. This is simply unacceptable. Logitech knows that this product doesn't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it wasn't tested properly. It is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great. Don't buy this product, you could be very disappointed. Note that I have seen another installation done by professional Windows system administrators that had the exact same problems. Now don't get me wrong: the hardware is very nice. I would highly recommend the Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks which is great and had none of the issues I have mentioned there 
About 2 1/2 years ago I finally got into the digital age. I began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there (Kodak, HP, store brands, etc. etc.). By far, the most superior paper is Canon. They make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints GREAT photos. I did a wedding album using Canon photo paper and the couple I gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they'd hired, which speaks volumes to the quality of Canon paper. I'd highly recommend that people use this brand. You won't be sorry 
All HDMI cables are created equal...well, yes and no. While the signal is 100% digital (which means that $20 $150 cables give the exact same picture quality), it doesn't mean that each HDMI cable type gives the same rejection of noise (signal to noise ratio) as other HDMI cables. I've had this cable a few weeks now, and am consistently getting digital "dropouts" every now and again (only that part of the image looks scrambled for a few seconds) -- very annoying while the action is in the scrambled section. Went out and bought the Monster HDMI cable (not exactly cheap, though...) -- the Monster cable gives the exact same picture quality as this cable, except the Monster cable did not experience the digital "dropouts". If you don't mind seeing the dropouts every now and again, this is a great cable. If you want a picture that doesn't experience any dropouts, get the Monster cable. Regardless, the picture quality is the exact same between the cables (minus the dropouts) 
I've loved these headphones for the year or two I've had them. I still love them now.... when they work. The problem is that the cord is shoddy. When I plug into my laptop I have a hard time keeping it working. I have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work. If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all. I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk. I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it. Overall I like these things, but I'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit 
You idiot, its not only for PSPs - the card can go in anything that has a memory stick duo slot [phones + cameras + PSP + TVs + computers 
I've found these headphones to be highly overrated. The noise cancelling is primarily from the snug fit in the ear. When the noise circuit is turned on, the background "hiss" becomes incredibly annoying. To be fair though, this model does remove some background low frequency sound, even in addition to the the noise reduction from the ear plugs. The frequency response during playback sounds like an old am radio 
I just purchased this product. In the instruction manual, it states that only the Brother AC adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty. Why is it that only a Brother adapter can be used when AC adapters are supposed to be standard? A tactic to increase sales? The adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars. In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off. The 2 line printing does look very nice. I have not used many of the other features and so cannot comment on those 
Just spent the weekend photographing and video recording lots of activity and didn't even get close to capacity. This is fantastic 
The unit operates as good as any other GPS system available, plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches. I am very impressed with the GPS, but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed. The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily. The unit deserves a five star rating, but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided. 
cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes. again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds.... 
I purchased two CDOs only to find out that some of the lights on one of them did not work. After 6 weeks, KDS finally replaced it. It did not cost me anything but time and frustration. After 2 months, my second one has now failed. Most of the trays do not eject. It is no longer returnable and I have CDs stuck in it. Do NOT make the mistake of purchasing even one of these. Go to K-Mart and get one of the old fashioned manual ones. You will be much happier 
-small button size -recording time is crap when used with the best batteries -hold button, many bugs with -bugs; files often end corrupt in various ways, meaning you get f***ed over -software is crap, also it cant convert to mp3, o and did i mention you have to convert in general not true for all ic recorders, which others record directly in mp3 for example -mic is without noice reduction -device is the most fragile ic recorder ever -a consumer grade product, not a professional grade product Go with the following: ds-2200 made by olympus, it smokes this ic recorder by a mile, and its tough and goes for about the same price perhaps cheaper. 
I have not had N.E.W. coverage for this Apple product however I had a washing machine covered by them. The washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same. N.E.W. used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off. Throughout, N.E.W. was great and made every effort to fix the machine. When the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that I paid for it. They did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that I actually had the machine 
When I first started using this, I loved it. It worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound. In fact, I bought a second one for my wife. Then, after about two weeks, it stopped working. It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time. I tried contacting Coby's support on the Web, but they were unresponsive. Luckily, Amazon took it back for a refund. Note that they no longer sell these directly. Bet they had too many returns.. 
The cups of these heaphone are a little small and they do fit snuggly on my head but after stretching them out a bit I must say they are very comfortable. If you dont like them at first wear them for a while, they will grow on you. 
After a bit of sweat I've managed to get the printer working fine from both my XP and MAC OS Tiger computers ...... until I unplug the direct ethernet cable to the router that is needed for set-up. Then nothing happens i.e. no wireless printing. I suspect it's an IP addressing issue having read a helpful article here (take note D-link - Amazon is becoming a better support site than your own!). Changing the IP address messes up my internet connection during install; the MAC works quite hard to re-establish the internet connection perhaps this breaks the connection to the printer? I dunno, but it's giving me a headache. Documentation troublshooting help are very, very weak time will tell if D-link on-line support are any better (22 hours no response from them yet....) I'm sure network wizards will have this little beasty up running in no time, but for normal people it's, well, a bit of a pain 
i wanted a top quality palm with the bells and whistles. this is pretty close to it but i had a few problems with the email and web features. granted i am not a techie, but connecting and checking email should be more straightforward. all the other features are top notch and overall i love my palm 
I have had my Axim x51v for about three months. I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord. Strengths: Just about everything. The processor is absolutely incredible. I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3! It sure seems like it. This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it. The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen. Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen. I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels. The screen is crystal clear. The battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery. Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones. Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day. WiFi is amazing. It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up. Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed Just about everything on this PDA is almost perfect. Weaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it's way better) Problems: Don't use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow. Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source. On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize. Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both. Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it. It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle. Conclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything. Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability. Everything works extremely well 
NEW are notorious thieves in the consumer electronics repair industry. I personally submitted for repair both a $1,600 video camera (Sony DCR-PC5) and a car CD player (a Sony CDX-C90, a $1,200 in-dash top of the line unit. If you've heard of it, you know what I'm talking about). I was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera (some ambiguous statement about logic board, power unit, etc. failure followed), and would have to pay ~$780 to have it fixed. I naturally refused, and was forced to keep my dead 4 month-old handycam, an unfortunate testament to some of Sony's now widely publicized QC issues. The reason I did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my CD player. I was told, explicitly, that if NEW could not fix it, they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of $1,000 (not even enough to cover the cost of the player). As an added insult, when they indeed could not fix the unit, they KEPT it, and I NEVER received a check!!! Simply outrageous! Blatant theft, and I'm not the only one who will tell you a story about NEW and such an act. They are IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of, and literally take your money and run/disappear. Don't expect to ever hear from them, should your camera stop working, and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand. Chances are, you will have to eat the loss, as I did. This product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund. I seriously thought it was a gag when I saw NEW was in charge of the coverage. What a joke! Whoever runs your company, NEW, ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused. The whole lot of you belong in an unfriendly prison 
Pros: Great battery life Compact, but not too small No extra dongle Cons: Included software is worthless, but you don't really need to use it $40 is a bit much considering that you can get cordless keyboard/mouse sets for around $30 nowaday 
Pros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small Cons: Stopped working, froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. But overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it 
I had slight confusion whether to choose the sony 64 MB memory stick, which is nearly the same price or this one, which has twice the memory capacity of the previous one. I choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise JR Electronics shipped it so quickly(You guys Rock!!!). This one comes par with sony memory media in every field. So why choose the one with lesser memory capacity. Choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space 
I bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp. The audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations. No lag while playing my Playstation 2 console... The only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press "SOURCE" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it's annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it's a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space 
I own a set of older Martin Logan speakers. Their quality is legendary with a price to match. So I was interested in maximizing performance. When I called their office for advice, one of the tech guys (excellent service, by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great, not the best or most expensive available, but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful. Add to that the free shipping, no tax and a total price saving of $12.00 and you can't do better than Amazon! 
I bought the Transcend 1 GByte card for my PDA. My Axim x51v immediately recognized it and is working flawless for the past few weeks. I am planning to get the 4GB model too which is currently retailing for $90 to $110 elsewhere. Har 
I bought this SD card on April 11. Unfortunately, the card doesn't work properly, in fact, my camera and my computer never detect it. Also, I recived a different card, it didn't like the picture on this page. I think I was swindled. Well, I had to buy another SD card 
I love my new Monster FM Transmitter! It's very easy to use and the reception is great 
One star is too many! (It should be negative one). This sad excuse for a television/radio has to be the worst piece of lame crud I have ever bought in my entire life. Picture fades into black, terrible reception which fades in and out as you move about the room, smells like burning plastic after a half-hour, and so on. Please, Amazon shoppers, don't waste any money on this! You might just as well throw the $15 out the window. Step up to something more reliable from a better manufacturer 
During the installation of the software on my PC running Windows 2000 Server, the installation program froze my PC completely. I had to turn off the PC, and now it does nothing when I turn it on. The lights on the front light up, but nothing happens at all. I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. I went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. Since I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system. He declined that offer. So, at the end of the day, I'm left with a dead PC, but, according to Netgear, a perfectly good wireless card and installation CD. No more Netgear for me, thank you! 
Like most other reviews, I will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings. What helped me is when I looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in. Now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit. Movies are amazing! My music collection never sounded so good. If you want to get away from it all for awhile, slip these babies in your ears and chill 
We previously had an AT cordless w/answering machine (1 handset) and always had trouble locating the one receiver - kind of like misplacing the TV remote. With 3 handsets, we are spoiled. Also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room. With the abilty to locate the phones anywhere in the house where there is an outlet, we were able to place one in our living room and another in our bedroom (which we can turn the ringer off). 
Great batteries for cameras. They charge quickly, and it's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time "just in case" 
I had Vonage since April, 2006. I finally switched back to Qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone (my cell phone, as my Vonage line didn't work) with tech support. Here is my experience: 1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone # over to Vonage. Don't be too excited about getting the first month free- if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over. 2) After my number was finally switched over, outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 20-30 seconds. Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute. This resulted in having to call the person back, saying "sorry the call was dropped- we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems...." This is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download, 600kbps upload) and a wireless 'g' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems. I spent no less than 4 - 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem. After talking with tech support, sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily- while I was on the phone with them- but return shortly thereafter. 3) As a result of the problems I had, I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working. Be warned, they are very hard-nosed about providing any credits for poor or no service. I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service, and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given. After the problem had been fixed (temporarily), I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month, not previous months of no or poor service. THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE. 4) Finally, in September, still with dropped calls from Vonage, I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service. I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage. And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back. In the end, I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works. I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees, etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not, which is unfortunate. In any case, I guess you get what you pay for. One last thing: Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan, they never will. This means eventually they will either go out of business, or have to raise rates. Save yourself the problems I had- pay the extra $ to get phone service that works 
When I purchased this product a couple weeks ago I wanted to make sure this purchase was worthwhile. I studied many other speaker stands and it just didn't seem I would have been getting the same quality. I received this pair a few days ago and originally thought they may be a little complicated to put together. They only took about twenty minutes to assemble and put my cube speakers on. The stands look great and go well with the cube speakers. I am happy I made this investment and will enjoy these for years to come. 
It has very good definition but is slow, even in the night is not that good and is slower 
I have had this phone for 20 hours - and am returning it. There is static noise on the line when people talk on the other end. The echo of my voice from the earpiece is very distracting - I find it very disconcerting. The wall mount bracket causes the base to stick straight out from the wall - and as a previous reviewer mentioned, is usually up to your nose given the location of most wall mounts. This strikes me as an unexcusable oversight on Motorola's part. Either make it desk only - or do the wall mount right. The speaker for the speakerphone feature is in the back of the phone - while the microphone is in the front of the phone. Dumb design - I feel like I'm either not listening or not being picked up when talking. The volume on the base speakerphone is too low at highest setting. I'm very disappointed in this phone. Much like a previous reviewer, the 1 star is only because I couldn't give it a 0 star rating 
This case is a veritable dirt magnet. It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk. However, it protects very well. One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen. However, it doesn't even touch the ipod. Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel. While it isn't quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on. This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted. It's still vibrant. One complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button. Truthfully this doesn't bother me, because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button. But those without could have a great deal of difficulty. Also, the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough, and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod, so I do not know how those would fare). Overall, it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on. It protects well, and you never have to take it off, even to plug it in. I would recommend it, though it is a bit pricy. In a bit of an update, with this case on, my iPod survived a ferret attack, with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case. I think this case is well worth the money. My iPod could have been destroyed, but it's perfect 
I've purchased several Logitech mice(cordless optical)and I've been satisfied with all of them, except for the battery life. I had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month. This new Logitech mouse is terrific. It's been several months and I have not had to change the batteries yet ... and I am not even using the on-off switch (I want to test the battery life without the switch first). Battery issues aside, the mouse is smooth, light and accurate. It was simple to install and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat 
Why would you want this item? Amazon is charging $50 MORE on this item than the 2nd Generation Shuffle! And, according to what I have read, THIS Shuffle isn't very derable. It doesn't even last a year! I don't know about you, but I'LL get a 2nd Generation Shuffle 
Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned 
After reading the online reviews of this product vs. the portable product I went with this one. Portability is not much of a need, I plan on being around a power outlet. The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it's about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal. Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit. I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home. So far I'm happy that I bought it 
We bought a set of these phones because they looked nice, and because AT is a reliable company. But these phones are the worst. After having them for about 3 weeks, we began having terrible results with the volume/speakers in the phones. I took them back, and got a new set. These lasted about twice as long, before the battery life just became worthless. We are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time - say, 1 hour. And you can't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out, and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again. And yes, we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge, and all that kind of stuff. Still...I have never used a more frustrating phone, nor will I ever purchase an AT phone again. I bought a new phone today, and once fully charged, I will take these AT phones out back and smash them with a hammer 
I am pleased with this printer. Considering the price, it is a good value. The cartridges are kind of expensive, but I guess most cartridges are these days 
Very effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over. Otherwise, no complains 
I bought this TV for my husband to take hunting but we can't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture. The TV is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen. I didn't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don't have cable. I tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other. I tried programming with the antenna on the TV and with separate rabbit ears. It would only pick up one of the three local network stations. It picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren't popular. I couldn't get a good picture on any of the stations and I tried adjusting all the menu items, brightness, hue, etc. It didn't even have a good black and white picture .... it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back. Sooooo, sooo disappointed because I wanted to be able to use this at work too. 
Works well with or without software installed. Good for home use and school or traveling. 
Worked for 6 hours, then just stopped transmitting. What a waste of cash. Do not buy this 
I purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone. The combination is killer. I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play. I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold. On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now. And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish. I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone. IMO, this is too complementary. For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. 
I have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well. It lives up to its claims. The "face tracking" feature is not always fast and accurate, but generaly works (in good light). This camera does require a significant amount of light to give good results, but then again what camera doesn't. Image quality is about as good as you will get from this type of device 
Though the concept is great, and the controls are straight forward and easy to use, the Belkin Reader falls short of usability. While out on a location, I was away from a power source and thought the Belkin reader would be a great alternative to lugging a laptop around for file transfers. Trying to transfer 1000 pics off a 1GB CF card was impossible. The reader would drain a fully charged ipod and still not finish the transfer. Though it claims firewire transfer speeds, I did some tests from home and found otherwise: 100 compressed 2K pics transferred via: USB1 card reader to computer 1 min 20 sec. PCMCIA card reader in laptop 45 seconds. Belkin Media reader 6 min. 45 sec This was just a simple example. You can see how hundreds of files would take 30 minutes or more. For the price, I'd suggest buying a few more memory cards and not worry about the transfers until you get home, unless you're in no rush and can charge up the ipod regularly 
This is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop. It's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case. It protects my laptop from surges through the AC outlet and phone jacks. I have been pleased with APC products for about six years. They provide excellent customer support. I highly recommend their products 
when i purchased this plan it was for a tv between $1000 and 1499.99. new contract claims that my purchase had to be under $1000 so they will NOT honor it. this means i do not have an extended warranty. i either want this warranty for the price that was agreed upon or a full refund. i'm happy i found out about this problem before i needed the warranty. 
The first unit couldn't even find FM stereo stations. It had similar FM specs as the Sony ST_JX410 AM/FM Tuner it was replacing. It was returned as a faulty unit. The replacement STRDE 197 was able to find stereo FM stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo. My 25 year old JX410 tuner did an excellent job on FM stereo stations. The second unit was returned for a refund. Sony's quality isn't what it use to be. I bought an Onkyo TX-SR304. The FM works fine with more features expandability. 
I find this printer to be better than HP or Epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles, just a solid printer that performs as I anticipated 
I have been a DVR user through Cox Cable for approx. 1 yr, and have always been disappointed. I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time, and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time, I decided it was time to try Tivo. I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12.95 per month. I received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered, very impressive since I didn't pay to have it shipped that quickly. The setup was reasonably straight forward. I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations, and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me: 1) My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs (DVR does this automatically). So I ordered the wrong unit. To be honest, I don't see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner, my family relies on dual tuners A LOT. I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system, to me it's like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed, a dual tuner is so much more useful. 2) I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network. No, you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50. Since I didn't know that, I had to rely on the phone line option. This really stinks, it is very very very slow. I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming, the system kept getting interuppted during download (yes I disabled call waiting). 3) When you use the online program guide, it covers up the entire screen. My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner (approx. 1/4) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide. We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on, but that won't work so well with Tivo. Plus, scrolling up and down is painfully slow, the screen takes for ever to refresh. 4) Similarly to item 3 above, when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely, you can only see the Tivo guide. Again, Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner. 5) Remote wouldn't work with my 42" Akai plasma. I can't fault Tivo too much on this one, none of the universal remotes seem to work with this TV for some reason. I did love some of the Tivo features and wish my Cox DVR had them: 1) Wishlist 2) Tivo Suggestions 3) Can access your Tivo through internet 4) View photo's through Tivo. In the end my items # 3 and 4 were things I just couldn't get past, so I returned my Tivo. They were friendly and helpful and I really wanted to like this product, but in my opinion it's not able to compete with the speed and power of the Cable companies DVR. 
Unfortunately my wife and I purchased this product without reading the posted reviews here. ALL are entirely accurate! I cannot calculate how many hours I have spent trying to figure out what is wrong. No loading, skipping, freezing, not OPENING when it freezes, all down the line, combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their defective DVDs. My wife was firmly of the belief the DVDs were just dirty but I finally decided (this agrees with one of the reviewers) there is a balance problem in the drawer. When there is a no-load, jiggling/adjusting the drawer sometimes (not always) fixes it, but only until the next time, and will not stop the freezing problems. If my wife had a dime for every time I said this thing is a piece of @*! she would be a millionaire. This is very late but if this product is still on the market in ANY form stay many miles away. And Philips' arrogant lack of response (as reported; I have no personal experience here) is virtually criminal in this day and age 
This phone is a total piece of garbage. Freezing, rebooting, not being able to connect to hot spots, not logging you out of skype if you are logged on at your computer at the same time. Horrible tech support. Can I add any more negative feedback? Oh yeah the rediculous ring tones and speaker quality. Thanks for nothing netgear and for making me wait 6 months on pre order for a real piece of plastic junk 
This is a great phone. Memory is easy to progam. The phone has 3 memory keys for emergenies and 9 additional memory keys for personal numbers. It can be used on a desk or hung on the wall. The only thing I don't like about the phone is the buttons on the handset. However, I knew about this feature before purchasing the phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a good basic phone 
I matched this model number up with the phone I have, and it is a perfect fit for the phone and for me. I stay on the telephone for lengthy conference calls most of my workday, and the headset types that go in the ear ended up causing soreness. This headset sits gently over my head with the earpiece lying on my ear. I'm told I can be heard very clearly without echo or fadeout. I would highly recommend this headset 
This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off). 
I paid about a dollar for this holder. Holds and protects the iPaq nicely. Can hold some credit cards as well as ID. Overall a decent product for a low price 
I didn't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning. The cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned (30 minutes) It didn't 
I purchased the case along with my new Palm TX to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it. It's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner. The little plastic catch in the lid half, which keeps the case closed, never seemed to work quite correctly, requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut. On a trip on March 3rd, this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away. Now it has no catch to keep it closed. Since the case cost me about $24 new and I'd only get about half price for the return, I figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return. I'll use a rubber band around the case, reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is. Save your money and don't buy this case. I don't remember reading the reviews before I ordered it -- so there's a $24 lesson 
I am working with my new PDA the Live Drive and is great to have akk ny videos, music and to write my notes and documents before my shift or meeting, and also the wireless connection is so great. I like the option that you can use it as an external drive 
I bought this unit to use with a boombox and it functioned well but after a few minutes it just went blank. I tried batteries in the boombox, AC power and two boomboxes because they thought the boombox was the problem But after two boomboxes I guess the problem is the Roady. Anyone else have this problem? I use the XM only at home with the boombox. Currently waiting for response from Crutchfield and Delphi. I will post again when (if) this is resolved. 
We bought three Creative players. My husband and I have the Zen micro and my daughter the Zen 20GB. All three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year. I didn't even use mine but maybe two hours per week. Good thing my daughter's was within her one year period by a couple of days. She still had to pay $25.00 Now my husband and I have to just junk ours and buy something else. Customer service is awful!! They won't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times. What a piece of garbage!! 
I've used these (and similar) cases for years. No problems, even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them. 1) I've never had one crack. 2) They hold the disc securely, but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it. 3) As long as you open them properly - from the front (clear) side by pulling near the corner(s) while holding the back (colored) side - they open fine 
I have spent time with lynksys and Dell, both of which say they have done all they can do, (from their manuals). Because I have had to finish phone calls without without solving the problem, I call back and get conflicting oppinions...this keeps me coming back. It still is not working, they have that in common. 
It broke after two uses. It has an auto shutoff if no detection after 30 seconds and I plugged it in to everything and it would shut off every 30 seconds. I was so mad I threw it out the window. What a waste of thirty bucks 
I am pleased at the sound of these speakers. I feel that for the price, it was a good purchase. The carrying case that is included is a nice addition. You can use the included A/C adapter or run it on batteries. Not only do I use these speakers with my iPod, but also for my Mac Book laptop. I don't need an overbearing sound, but these portable speakers are just right 
Do not buy this item, it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase. And I bought 2 of them, so statistically it's not jsut me. The first time the door broke, and without the door there's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection. The second time, the USB part broke off and got stuck in my computer and I could not put it back together. All in all, not the best product out there. Try instead the Belkin USB to Ethernet adaptor 
I would have given it a five star but sense it's the only one I have ever used I had nothing to compare with. I have used it nine tines and it worked perfect every time. Sturdily made. 
Easy to operate and good focus. Just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam 
I have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of Memorex and so far I have not had any problems. They work just fine on my Sony dvd burner 
I like the phone's simplicity and ergonomics. It's fatal flaw is the lack of range. My office is about 50ft away from the base, and I get unacceptable interference. Both plain old AT GE 900 handle this distance without any problems 
There is a light that ALWAYS stays on and it is distracting, as others have noted. Otherwise, it is great. Good design, works well, no complaints. But that light...WHY did they design it with that? 
I have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor. I shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose. For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.) But after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various "drives" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing. Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement. Most of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad. It is of course possible that there's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won't be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I've been through, just in case 
I love these speakers and the price was great 
I'll admit, I'm not the techno wizard some on this panel seem to be, but then again, I don't believe you should have to be to operate what should be something simple, like a handheld computer. In essence, the title of this review says it all. Almost $300 and several months later, I am unable to get this hunk of junk to even turn on. Let alone connect to a server. All of these things were supposed to be fixed by a 'patch' that if someone can download from the HP website, I'd love to see it. All downloads came back with an Error message when I attempted to download. Long story short, you'd be better off buying a laptop. HP is not known for their handhelds, do not buy this product or anything similar to this from HP. You will be sorry. 
I live in a particularly bad spot for TV reception and have been forced to use cable. This antenna brings in several local stations but the quality of the picture is unsatisfactory. So, unfortunately, for me it's either back to cable or try an amplified outside antenna. Miles Kenned 
I have used GPS units from Cobra, Garmin, and Lowrance. I consider this Cobra unit to be one of the best. I started with the Cobra but it was stolen after a month. Then I bought the Lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the Cobra. I returned the Lowrance and bought the Garmin 340. Advantages of the Cobra is that it has a large screen and a solid mount (despite its size). The interface isn't quite as intuitive as Garmin but once you learn it it is actually better. The traffic service is also nice (costs more with the Garmin). The Cobra is the most capable of the GPS units I mentioned but overall I am happier with the Garmin because of it's smaller size and lower price 
Lenmar Is great to work with, When Beach Audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment. Beach Audio told me I would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that I had to purchase. POOR RETURN POLICY. So I just sent it to Lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one. Only took one week to get it. GO LENMAR. I've been able to watch on a 10in. Portable DVD Two (2hr) movies on just this battery with a little to time to spare. ***NICE BATTERY*** 
Well, the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock. Its VERY simple. just put your ipod on there and ROCK OUT TO THE BEAT. The bose quality is very obvious, and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it, which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido. The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod, and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about, isnt it...?) Basically, im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone 
I am a soldier serving in Iraq. I bought an Ipod while deployed and figured it would get ruined by the dirt, dust and my combat duties. I was fortunate to find the iSkin Eclipse. It is perfect for this environment. It completely encases the ipod to protect it from dirt and dust. It also has a hard exterior faceplate the protects the ipod from damage. The Eclipse also makes it easy to use the controls; even when playing the new games put out by itunes. To put it simply I am one happy soldier, thanks to the iskin Eclipse 
I had the same exact experience with the poor fit of these headphones and the rude customer service. Their 'surround-sound' HE-592 phones don't fit well either. On the phone Philips told me to buy a part at RadioShack to resolve my problem. They couldn't give me an RS part number because "it isn't their product" but they recommend that over selling me or sending me replacement ear pieces. According to them this problem was all my fault, I should have realized it sooner, saved my receipts packaging an returned them within 30 days. From a technology standpoint the electronics are outstanding for the size and price. I like the performance of the phones on planes, trains, etc. They really work well but I am amazed that Phillips would risk losing customers over pennies worth of silicone. It is a shame Philips can't do better with the customer touchpoints like the ear piece design, their phone support and part replacement policies. Take a look at Shure's products. Shure sells replacement foam and triple flange sleeve ear pieces for their products. If you are in the same boat with me and like these except for the fit I think the triple flange sleeves may work as a replacement for the stock Phillips ear pieces 
I'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz-G5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase, so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use, I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the pen--both in design and responsiveness. Design: the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos, and there's a good reason why: the Graphire pen is thinner, lighter, and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable; in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn't feel like it has any durability. Additionally, the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it. Responsiveness: There is a half-second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder-related options--opening windows, selecting files, etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable, but if you, like me, use the pen for everything, not just drawing, believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand, the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all, so I know it's the pen and not my computer. The tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine, but the bottom line is that it's more important for me to have a responsive, durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies, but for those who have, this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. You'll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the best overall driving experience. I need the driving experience, so I'm going back to the Intuos--wire and all. 
The numbers on the clock are not bright enough to see in the day light I wish they were brighter and bigger 
After ordering non-OEM inks from several different places on the web (and having some problems with them), I discovered that Amazon sold OEM at great prices. I went to my local office supply store and purchased a complete set of 5 inks for my Canon Pixma iP4000 at a cost of $75. Later that day I found them on Amazon at almost 1/2 the price! Also, when it comes to OEM inks, I discovered that they seem to last almost 3 times as long as the generic and refilled versions. 
I live in the Atlanta area and was never able to get a good sound quality coming from the Belkin FM transmitter. It seemed like I was listening to a FM station that was not coming in good 
I put this item in my cart -- it was one of the "buy both now" deals. The problem is, the first item was sold by Amazon, with free shipping, the second item was sold by another company with outrageous shipping costs. I caught this easily while checking out but just wanted to post a "buyer beware" to check the shipping costs 
Ordering was fast and easy. Could not detect any inferiority in the cartridges and will order them again 
It failed Dragon Naturally Speaking's sound tests, tests easily passed by the cheapo mike included with the program. And just try to return it. Antonline stonewalls, Plantronics doesn't respond at all 
I have a Gateway CX2610, and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes. Enter this Targus lapdesk. When folded out, it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours. But wait, there's more! I had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics. However, I use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing. It also puts the screen at a better height as well. The desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode. So, it's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop. I highly recommend it 
I purchased this hub back in September. I plugged it in and I'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment, I've had no problems. It doesn't take up too much room even with 7 ports. My only complaint isn't with Amazon, it's with D-Link. After I sent in the rebate info, I got a card from D-Link saying my request wasn't valid because I hadn't purchased it from the right store. But I called them, and in about 10 minutes I had the problem cleared up and had my rebate a week later. I HIGHLY recommend keeping copies of all the rebate info, just in case.. 
I received the correct Q5949X cartridge. My calculations for cost per page is only 2 cents per page, which is contrary to another reviewer's claim of 12 cents per page. $120.00 divided by 6000 pages equals 2 cents per page. 
Do not be fooled when the description says this stand holds up to 21 monitors - that is only true for *flat-panel* monitors, not traditional CRT monitors. Note that the weight rating says 50 pounds! Most standard 19 monitors weigh 60 pounds or more. I purchased this item at a Staples near me, and brought it home to use with my 19 CRT. After placing the monitor on the stand, the stand bobbed up and down and seemed as if it would completely bend at any moment 
The sound crackles if the cord bends a bit at the connector. All around poor quality and construction. I'm thinking about returning it.. 
A simple, cheap investment. This CF reader actually does what it should, i.e. transfer info from compact flash to the computer. Previous Kodak 1.0 multi-card reader had issues after a few weeks, and stopped working after 2 months. This one is much faster and is still working. Ahhhhh 
The picture shows the cassette feature along with the car kit. The cassette did not come with the kit. Very disappointed 
It was not worth the cost to ship it back 
It works great! I really like it. There is one small problem though. The lid is REALLY hard to take off! I've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little, but not much. There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it. I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion 
If you want very basic capability this is the wireless adapter for you. Slow but steady and inexpensive 
also import a cd , money down the drai 
I wanted a keyboard that I could use in low light with both my PC and Mac, and this one is reasonably o.k. Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys. But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life 
I must say Moster XP speaker wire makes a huge sound inprovement on mt 6.1 home theater setup my side and rear channels are so clear and crisp . I have these runing threw my walls and ceiling and the intall was a brezz do the jacket by these cables you will love them for your surond speakers Wayne mn 
I bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so 
Now, imagine my astonishment. After receiving this beautifully designed futuristic looking set from my favorite communication device manufacturers, I set it up only to realize that the cordless phone only works when there is a direct line of site to the base! Unbelievable!! I live in a compact apartment ok, and believe me when I say it isn't 20 feet between the base and my bed room, and last night after setting up, I retreated to my room took up the cordless handset to make a call only to realize that there was no connection to the base. This phone in a nutshell, looks good, but it sucks!! 
DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY PIECE OF JUNK!! I purchased this unit with faith in SONY. Well forget it!! after 4 months the unit failed and began reading "disc dirty" half way through each recording. I sent the unit back for repair. They claimed to have "fixed it" but when I received it back it STILL failed on each disc (note that these failures RUIN the disc!). They sent me a brand new unit. GUESS WHAT..?! It failed after 3 months with the SAME PROBLEM!! I sent it back for repairs. AGAIN they claimed to have "fixed it". Well, it malfunctioned IMMEDIATELY!! I sent it back AGAIN!! This time they gave me a refurbished unit. I know you wont believe this...but the unit is WORSE than the other two!! They are currently sending me ANOTHER new unit. But I have no doubt this one will STILL be a piece of crap. They simply don't have this technology down. SONY should NEVER have put this junk on the market. BEWARE!! - UPDATE - They sent they new unit. Guess what? PIECE OF JUNK. Fails on discs writing and when reading written discs. After trying FOUR of these units I can assure you this is a LEMON. Please note these positive reviews are from buyer who had their units for two weeks or similar time periods. I have had four different units for ONE YEAR and can tell you THIS IS JUNK! Selling this crap on ebay and buying a REAL unit. NOT SONY! 
Stay away from Vonage! After more than 1 month, still don't have phone number transferred. Can't get thru to customer service...very long wait. Paying 2 phone bills...so much for saving cost and so-called service. Called to cancel service, and customer service rep promised to put account/billing on hold until phone number transfer is done...finally something positive from customer service department 
Don't waste your money. What iRiver doesn't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead, the system is useless. I will never buy one of their products again and I'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iRiver products. My system cost me $[...] and it is now as useless as the customer service department at iRive 
I am still awaiting resolution of a problem I have with these drives. In writing DVDs I get verification errors. This proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure. The drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the IDE bus, but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire 
this is a great little product to take the place of the builtin finger pad on a laptop.....the USB just plugs in and the mouse is the perfect size for comfortable us 
Couldn't get any SW stations, but AM and FM worked great and the hand crank charged up the cell phone, after a lot of cranking 
This mouse was barely functional. It did move the arrow across the screen, but it was in a very random fashion. I went to the Macally website and downloaded the latest drivers. Still no luck. I'm sending this back. Guess I'll have to stick with my reliable Kensington. Too bad it's so ugly and doesn't match my ice keyboard. Oh well... function over form 
I've been a fan of Sony earbuds for many years. Due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest Sony earbuds, I decided on purchasing these Panasonic headphones. I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones. I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs. I've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings. It's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise. I like the around the neck feature. As far as quality, the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it. As far as the performance of the headphones, I'm really disappointed in these headphones. My factory Creative headphones had out performed these. The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player. The mids and treble sound like crap. Don't waste your money on these! Now I have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones! argh! 
Unit's range shorter than expected, but I feel that I got what I wanted, and paid for. Shipping and delivery were great 
I got this print server about a month back. Initially it took me 4 hours to get this thing installed and running in the wireless mode! After I got it setup, it worked fine for a week. But, then the wireless connection with the print server got flaky, so I switched to the wired mode. All was well again, but then after a couple of weeks the wired connection got flaky. It stopped printing and didn't recognize my HP-1200. After fiddling around with it for a few hours I finally got the contraption working again. But, now my latest problem is that the print server prints garbage to the printer! Plugging the printer directly in to a computer works fine, but the print service somehow corrupts the data going to the printer and I end up with pages of garbage and error messages. SUMMARY: This thing was a beast to set-up and every time something goes wrong, it takes a phenomenal amount of time to debug and correct. That's in addition to the questionable reliability of this device. I say steer clear of this thing. I'm now shopping for something better and never buying D-Link again 
SHORT cord cannot be replaced, so don't bother with this phone unless you can sit RIGHT by it to chat. 
Works great in my Cingular 8125 phone. I can't believe how inexpensive these have become! More space than I'll likely every need, and no speed issues (noting that the 8125 is no speed demon itself; I can't attest to this product's performance in something that's inherently faster) 
You would think that Panasonic Cordless phone and Panasonic Hands-Free Headset would work well together, being that they are sold by the same company. Well, that is clearly not the case. I bought this headset specifically for the reason that it is sold by Panasonic to work with their cordless phones. I've tried it a few times and each time I get the same response from the person I'm talking to. They say I sound too far away, that they can barely hear me. This product is clearly not worth it 
I'm pissed. I feel I've been ripped off. The 3rd party vendor delivered a defective unit. I want to return it. I have been unable to determine how to return this unit for a refund. I may never buy through Amazon again 
I wanted to get something better than the standard earphones for my Ipod. I saw some good reviews and this brand has been known always for great headphones. Bought these and was shocked at the terrible sound quality. Yes, the sound is clean, but TOO clean. The highs are too high leading to tinny and over-brassy sound. Voices have too much hiss. There is virtually no low end bass of any type. Very disappointing 
This card is on its way back to Amazon. I purchased it as it was one of the "recommended items" with the camera I also purchased, never mind that it doesn't work with the camera. I'm not hugely tech savvy--I (wrongly) assumed that any items recommended with the main item (a $500 camera) would be compatible. Check to make sure that any recommended accessories will actually achieve what you want them to. 
I have a VOIP setup with voicepulse. This phone works great as long as I don't assign phone numbers to the presets. When I do it stops ringing after a few days. The lights flash indicating an incoming call and I can answer the phone if I notice the lights flashing but it doesn't ring. If I reset the phone to defaults, erasing all presets, then it works OK. I got a new one from AT and it does the same thing. I love the headset button to switch between speaker and headset. Let me know if you know a workaround 
These earphones are excellent quality. Noise that gets in from outside is so low that I can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me. In addition, the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones. These earphones do in fact rest in your ear. It can be slightly uncomfortable to put them in the first time, but you quickly get used to it, especially when sound is playing. In addition, the package includes three sets of differently sized earpieces including the default mid-sized piece shown. 
Do not be deceived by the photo this thing is tiny. If that is what you are looking very small low volume very portable I suppose it is ok but over price for what you get. I think $30.00 would have been about right. There is no bass response and for there size how could there be. I am keeping them but only because they are so small they might come in handy for hotel use only! The packaging is very cool but the fidelity is non existent 
One of the reasons I chose this mouse, was because Apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling. It turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others. It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add. Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don't. Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I'd buy something else 
This equipment is simply and perfect a viable connection to the world "where you are"!. My work forces to me to travel to very distant sites where the communication was difficult and this creates a access point to me for connected to the world via Interne 
The item I bought had to be returned due to the fact it did not wor 
It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box. The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would get 'trapped' inside the unit. And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether. Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should. If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully; a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one. Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances. 
The z-5450 has good points, reasonable cost, ease of use and ease of setup. It has a major fault in a buzzing noise made when the unit is turned on. Give this item a pass, wait for the next generation and a guarantee that this problem has been corrected 
as far as using the ipod as a recorder I think an actual digital recorder would get better sound. The italk picks up all ambient sound. I have even used it with an external mic and still not wowed with the clarity 
My Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use. I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes. It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period, until yesterday. The buttons, switches, and display still work perfectly, but only very faint white noise can be heard, whether via speaker or via earphone. The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control. The batteries are new, and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries. 
As long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again. They sound PERFECT. I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound. These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall! Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy. The only things to be aware of are the following: First, you have to break them in. They start sounding better after a few hours of use. Second, they don't have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s. Finally, plenty of sound escapes. So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral. Other than that, you have no excuse. Put your iPod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong, and order these (or if you don't want to fork out $40, order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these, and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range.) 
Operation of the Sony DVPNSS550/B single disc DVD player has been straight forward. Picture quality is very good, and the desired basic features have functioned without problems. In other words, in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player, quality and reliability have been high. Price too was very reasonable. That means durability is the last quality to consider, which is why I have given the player a 4 rather than a 5. There is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years. But we won't know that for years. 
Great product for getting all those old home videos on DV 
We purchased this system less than two years ago. It has seen light to moderate use. Several days ago, the speakers started intermittently cutting out. This afternoon, the subwoofer popped several times--then caught fire! Fortunately, my son was able to extinguish the flames before much damage was done. Beware!!!! 
One of the best gadget-products I've ever bought. The installation and connection was completely flawless. It worked the first time and has been working since (and I even used the Powerline ethernet adapter to connect back to my router). I have my cable TV on one input and my security system on the secondary input. Using my cellular Data connection on my laptop, I can watch tv or look at my security system from anywhere in the country 
I love the iShuffle. It does the job. Not many features, but makes my 2-hour commute livable. i put all my podcasts up top and list the songs in alpahbetical order (by artist name) so all is organized. It's like flying blind, but who said blind was impossible? Certainly not Helen Keller 
this unit has a/v in. my thought was that one could play video games on it, or view images from a camcorder/digital camera. however, all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen. so it does not allow me to do all i wanted. it is also a bit on the loud side. if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit. i got one of those also, and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor. it also does not make much noise 
never received the item. Have to go thru the process of filing a claim with UPS for lost/not delivered item. No way to complain to Amazon.com. 
I returned this thing the day after I bought it. I should of been clued in when I purchased it at the store, ALL the Transpod models had a little sticker on them advising them about the store's return policy. I thought it a little unusual at the time, but after listening to the thing I understand why now. I'm sure a lot of people had been returning this model. The sound quality was really bad. You have to turn your stereo WAY up to hear the music, and even then it sounds almost as bad as AM radio. I'll add that the files I was playing were 192Kbps aac encoded files so they're decent quality too 
It was great at first until the connector to iPod break by itself. The bluetooth signal wasn't the best, it loses signal constantly. I had to re-sync and paired it up several times over a month period. The high price iMuffs MB210 from WI-GEAR gives a better promise with the ability to stop your iPod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone. Its Bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on iPods with dock connectors, likely will not break as easily. I sure hope Logiteh will follow suit in this trend 
I bought this since it's economical, compact, didn't need cabling (although it has an extension if you need it), advertised a whopping 108 mbps. Well so much for that: 1) Drivers are problematic and causes conflicts with XP SP2. My first ever blue screen of death in about 3 or more years running XP came this item 2) It is EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE: - already mentioned repeatedly, it overheats - it drops connections randomly and yes, the only way to re-acquire the signal is to unplug and plug back in - It's utility is worthless, just install the driver (if you can). If you try using WPA, forget about using this utility, just use Windows to configure it. - I've also found out that it's better if you just remove this utility from the STARTUP (don't run it at all) so that Windows can do everything it needs to connect, which is faster and more reliable. Be careful not to UNINSTALL, since it will also remove the driver...just remove it from your Windows Startup folder list. Netgear has an FAQ about this problem, but I'm not going to tweak Windows and risk more stuff for this cheap piece of hardware. 3) 108 MBPS? Yeah right. You'll need the RIGHT KIND OF access point/wireless router for this, if not, it's 54 mbps. This was one of the selling points, but it's definitely a "gotcha". You're limited to specfic equipment, specific channel (6), so if you have neighbors on the same channel, well, you get the picture 
Using Rechargeable AAA batteries, with the Battery Saver feature turned on, about two hours. Sometimes I get more using alkalines, but not much more. Honestly, this unit is worthless, because I can't trust the batteries. Order a Garmin Etrex Legend instead. It isn't much more expensive, larger or heavier, and it includes a base map of roads, towns, and shorelines. The Legend comes with a cable to transfer data from your computer. The Legend's screen is a bit larger, but shows much more detail. And - the batteries last hours and hours. 
I've had the X2 for roughly 14 months. The X2 was used for watching movies (about once every 2 weeks) and big sports event (NCAA/NFL finals.. etc). The unit worked up to about 1200 hrs, then the lamp blew. I was hoping to get to at least 1500 hrs before the lamp went out. Good picture quality for the price (799) but short lamp life (get extended warranty). Check other units first 
I do not have a hearing problem, but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high volume.. this phone fills the bill -- at least so far! The only caveat: no speakerphone, which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold. 
These discs are not really TDK - they are low-quality discs branded and priced as TDK. I have a Samsung S182M DVD Burner and it will not recognize these discs at all. It just spins them around and around forever. The one time I got it to recognize one of these, it reported that it was Media ID Daxon0016s. Avoid these. 
I picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight). Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses). Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding. My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650. 1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones) 
Not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod. The unit is not perfect, it does freeze occasionally, but the re-set function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions. Sound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and you'll love it. This is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player, Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3, quit working the week the warranty ran out. Thumbs up on this one 
Although this policy is thru Apple, it is 2x the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations. One is Crutchfield.com which has a 2 yr. plan for $29.99 which starts *after* the standard Apple 1 yr labor coverage (for a TOTAL OF 3 YEARS). Apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for $59.99, rather than a total of 3 years for $29.99 thru Crutchfield 
These earphones provide excellent sound for the money. Rich bass, sharp treble and tight sound isolation with the comfortable and adjustable rubber earpieces. However I experienced painful electric shocks in both ears if I put pressure on my eardrums, such as getting up from a chair. And that was before I stood in the puddle of water. Just kididng. Shocks occured in first and Sony-provided replacement pair. They eventually replaced with an on-the-ear model. I have no problems with other Sony headphones or earphones, I think the speaker membrane was positioned too close to my eardrums. Since there are on other comments about this issue, I'll assume its isolated, but beware of shocks on perhaps a smaller scale. 
I bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good Macintosh support. Unfortunately the player does not work well with the Macintosh. The included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import DSS files. The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window. The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1. The DS-2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder. It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them, but it will only play one file. If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it. Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible. There is an export function in the menu, when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears. Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh. Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and re-recording it with another program 
I have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters, They are burning at 8X in my NEC 2500A burner. That is pretty considering that it is advertised at 4X. Hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years 
This thing sucks. I wasted my money. No more Griffin products for me 
First off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor. My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N. These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic. Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway. For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being. Installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago. When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own. But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting. When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own. One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics). And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs. I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones! This is a really a fine monitor! Now for a few small negatives. One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers. I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers. Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with. Strains my neck. The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors. With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected. For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4" from the desktop. On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches. On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop. It's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to. If all else fails, other monitor stands are available. As with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation. The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly. The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things. However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly. All in all, I'm very impressed so far, and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor! By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that. I can't complain about that speed! My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free? Go figure! Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor 
Agree with the prior reviewers. I can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses! 
I am a huge Logitech fan and buy their products in the truck load, unfortunately, this webcam is a dog with fleas. The picture is blurry, the lighting is abmismal in low light and you can just get better performance from a less expensive web cam. I am still a Logitech fan, but you can get better performance from QuickZoom 
This thing does a horrible job at detecting wifi networks. I have to be within 10 feet of my router to get a 50% signal (even though I can walk out tot he edge of my house and easily still get a good connection). If it does detect Bluetooth, which half the time it doesn't (regardless of it being active), it cancels out the wifi detection. So if you have a bluetooth headset, and you're talking, the thing will just let you know that yes, there is a bluetooth device around. Thanks. I was wondering 
This portable cd holder is perfect for me. I work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym. My cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd's. I like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch. I would recommend it to anyone 
Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original Panasonic or Samsung 42 inch plasma TV for Free! I got mine from this web site: awesomestufffree.com/plasma-t 
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all. The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas. I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs. Anyone got ideas? 
I have to admit, the price of this item got me. It's now 40 bucks down the drain as it has failed to work completely. It worked for about 8 months but was very fuzzy. The quaility was that of an AM radio station. Recently, it quit working altogether so now I am back in the market for one that will work 
we have this for our 30gb ipod and it works fine in both our cars.....very handy and a must buy!! 
this stereo works great and its cute and small so it doesnt take up alot of room, it lights up blue when u turn it on in the dark and i love the remote, now i dont have to get up to switch the station 
This music player was decent: Nice look, controls, and sound. There are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive. There are really good things about this unit; however, the faults are just too great; thus, superseding the great features. However, the reaction to your key pushes, and file search are way too slow. The software is pretty nice, but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you didn't ask it too. That gets very annoying. For example, I just want the file to be named as is, with no tags, but the Zen software will add tags no matter what, even if it has to put in the word "unknown". It also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover. The worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months -- unprovoked! It was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged, but I switched it up and found out that it was the Zen. Then I read online, and what do you know -- it's consensus, the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem. Some people even found some fixes, and I've tried them, but to no avail. But then again, why do I have to fix a fairly new product? If you're going to have a fault when it comes to a music player, you DON'T want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless! I'd give it at least three stars as I was quite satisfied with it, but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook 
About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, I've used all of them, had their (file removal) tech help give up. In this day age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself. If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care. How important are your pictures to you? Frederic 
I have used this 128 MB XD Memory card and it works fine. The pictures are good. I have had no problems. I now have this memory card and the standard 16 MB card that came with my camera. Good deal. 
Bike did not run right from the beginning. THe battery did not stay charged. After awhile just quite running altogether. Company was not very usefull. Warranty only 90 days. Do not buy this peice of junk 
I bought these headphones on the recommendation of a friend, and he was sooo right! The moment when the noice-cancelling algorithm kicks-in on a noisy flight is just sublime. I frequently use them without input, just tuning out the background noise on the aircraft...they even work well on squalling rug-rats a few rows away... 
This receiver doesn't work in rural areas. It doesn't work as well as a cheap battery powered fm radio 
We bought 3 of these and every one has dead pixels. It's not a ton, but one monitor has three that are red in the center of the screen, and other has a few that are bright green in the corner. Not a huge deal, but there are some in all 3 
Amazon does not ship to Post Office Boxes. The mouse could ONLY be shipped to a post office box per Amazon shipping proticol. Therefore, after TWO attempts to purchace this product from Amazon I had to buy elsewhere. If you live where the United States Postal Service does not deliver the mail to your house, pass of this item if not Amazon. I have considerable expierance buying mail order and online and this is the first time I have found a company setting rules that actually prevent the buyer from recieving the product 
These earphones are the best I ever had. I never had to try other pairs of earphone because I absolutely loved these that I keep buying it! After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen. 
I AM DISGUSTED TO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH CRUCIAL MARKETS THIS CARD AS COMING WITH A DRIVER FOR WIN98SE, IT DOES NOT. THE CD IT CAME WITH DID NOT HAVE A DRIVER (although it said it did) THE WEB SIGHT DOES NOT HAVE DRIVERS AND AFTER TWO PROMISES ON THE PHONE FROM CRUCIAL TECH SUPPORT PROMISING TO SEND ME ONE, I STILL DON'T HAVE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS DRIVER EXISTS. SO MUCH FOR TRUTH IN ADVERTISING AND AMERICAN COMPANY INTEGRITY 
This has to be the worst keyboard I've purchased. It's my first wireless. I've used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this. With the added snap-on plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high. Without it there is a 'hump' where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle. The plastic is really bad. It feels really cheap and slick. Before I purchased this I had been trying to get in tough with Logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond. So, bad product....company on the slide.....doesn't add up to a good value. Logitech used to be the best company out there...or at least one of the best... 
shipping was outrageous, thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a F'n postage stamp, but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than I did for the item, could have bought it at walmart for less this way. Buyer beware, I got took 
I'm going to cover compatiblity, sound, and comfort. OVERVIEW. Although I wish these were as cheap as the IPOD, $39 + $6 shipping isnt bad either. I have done the heat treatment (using boiling water) and the headphones seemed to open up more. When the headphones came in the box, the ear pieces were really close together. So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head. I plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more. SOUND. Sound quality is excellent. COMFORT. The only thing I don't really like is this style of headphone. I don't really like the band to go around the back of my head, causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head. COMPATIBILITY. I have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord. FEATURES. Coolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls! About 3X feet away 
I recieved this unit 3 bussiness days after I ordered it. Fast shipping. To bad when i recieved it it only worked for 2 minutes!!! Sending back tomorrow, not sure if i want another one. Only comes with usb charger, no wall charger 
Works good, small, and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it, though slightly costl 
When i first came across this particular microphone i had my doubts. Considering the price of it i just couldn't see it holding up for what i wanted to do. to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations. For recording vocals this mic is amazing. a real professional sound for a extremely low price. i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material 
I purchased a Biopod in March of 2006. Received brand new unit that included Omnipass software version 2.09. This software version released in 2004. Contacted company that produced the software and they refused to upgrade to their latest version (v4) that had been released a month earlier unless they charged me the upgrade fee. The version of software that comes with the Biopod (v2.09) pretty much only works with Internet Explorer and other Microsoft software. The new version (4) supposedly works with Firefox and several other non-Microsoft software programs. I recommend you avoid this product due to old software. I returned mine and am ordering the IBM Fingerprint Reader 
I just bought a new RatpadzGS to replace my four year old ratpadz. Compaired to the old Ratpad, the RatpadzGS is made with a lower density Cheap-O(tm) plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech G7 mouse. When using the mouse on the GS it causes the curser to sort of stutter along. Overall I would pass on this product, for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad. 
The software it is sent with is different than the instructions given, I have yet to get it to work with my laptop w/xp and a Ir HP laser jet. It may work fine for some cell apps phones etc. 
Don't waste your money. What iRiver doesn't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead, the system is useless. I will never buy one of their products again and I'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iRiver products. My system cost me $[...] and it is now as useless as the customer service department at iRive 
This product came with an italian users guide. In addition the specification fails to state the thickness of this wall mount. It turns out its about 3.5 inches thick and with the thickness of the monitor itself it stands out very far from the wall. I RETURNED THIS BACK TO AMAZO 
Problem #1 - out of hte box, these units are assigned 192.168.0.10 as an IP address. find if your network is on the .0 subnet. So I had to change my entire network over to this in order to get it configured. Problem #2 - once changed, now i have Ip address issues because of the existing clients picking up the .10 address. Problem #3 - If you incorrectly specificy the SSID/wep key or IP address, you have to put it back to the defaults and start over. there's no way to configure the unit Problem #4 - it just plain don't work as it should. Easily the most difficult unit i've ever had to configure. It's a shame that I'm swearing off linksys as their prices are good. Despite it's decent price, stay away from this one 
I am extremely pleased with the purchase. I am using it in my office. Simple plug and play (no brainer)!! If I get the MIR the cost comes to $5. None can better that. Transaction with Amazon was flawless as usual 
I've used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish. Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish. The only drawback, and it is minor, is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally, it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit. Yes, it would draw down batteries more quickly, but as an option it would be user selected. All in all, a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination, and one I am quite glad I purchased. Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body. But rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, "WOW, Lord! What a ride!" 
I have long struggled to find the perfect remote. The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good. Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls. I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT. The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house. The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote. For the price you can't beat it. All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable. Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star. Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880. If cost is no object, then there are better remotes. For the price, I can't find one better 
I bought this reader because I wanted to avoid having my camera and all its cable attached to my pc to download the pictures; and with this reader I could leave my camera (and its cables) in its case and just download the picture with the memory card, I recomend this product.... 
After waiting almost 6 months for this Skypephone, and its competitor from Belkin, to come to market through numerous postponements, I just gave up and bought an Asus P525 smartphone. For just over double the price of the Netgear I got a Windows CE PDA with GSM capability and full Skype compatibility. When browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through GSM or Skype. Because you have built-in Wi-Fi, you can make Skype calls and chats from any covered area, plus you can go on the internet using IE and check your e-mails with Outlook. I have also read that the Skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the Netgear and the Belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power, whereas with a Windows CE-based device you have much faster processors that allow a Skype software closer to the one used on PCs. For those of you alergic to Windows, just wait for the Skype for Symbian release and buy a Nokia or SonyEricsson smartphone. Bottom line: Skype is too good an application to be wasted on poorly designed hardware 
I was disappointed with these earphones. The sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated. The $30 Sony MDR-EX51 earphones I already owned sounded much better 
I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller. After having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three "SELF CAL"s, then said "SERVICE REQUIRED". I called Escort Radar and was told "If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector." It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was "still confused", so I returned it for a replacement. My second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me "if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems." Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that "excessive heat" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100� heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90� or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35�, would you??? The most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money. 
I recently received an iPOD Photo and after loading in tons of CD's I said . . . hey why not buy an all in 1 adapter for my car. My transpod arrived but I had difficulty inserting the adapter into my car's charger. After working that out and using it everyday for a week, it stopped working. I realized that the fuse had blown. It's small and relatively compact unlike the Griffin RoadTrip, but it's a whole lot of drama for the price. With regard to the quality of the sound through my vehicle's audio system, I am extremely disappointed. What sounds like a million dollars through headphones does not translate to what you hear through fm radio frequencies. I have adjusted the iPOD's equalizer and played around with some options inside my car, but I am extremely disappointed. If someone has a better alternative . . . GOD BLESS YOU but don't waste your money on this product 
I'm very happy with this product. It's great value for the price. The corded phone with answering machine means there's always a phone that's not dead and perfect for the home office area. The cordless phone can be used to check the answering machine messages. Lot's of features 
have had no problems with this item, and it's a good price for the powered kind of USB hubs, which I have found are pretty necessary for most USB items. 
This product is awsome, i intalled it on my car with a sony stereo system, i placed the end of the ilink cable inside of a compartment of my car so i could put my ipod in, the sound quality that the cable delivers its outstanding, besides, it does not look like a cheap cable, it has a thick rubber coating that gives it some stiffness.... If you are realy thinking on connecting your ipod to your home or car stereo this is the right solution 
This item does exactly what it's suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be, there is a lot of cord hanging around 
Great sound, but the build quality is just not there. On a recent trip to Europe, the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver. They are only two months old and I always keep them in the case! I had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together. Since then I've also had to superglue the right bud as well. Also, the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead, revealing the fine speaker wire underneath. I don't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad. They are great sounding and comfortable, but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners. Be warned 
From reading the reviews the product weighs 14 oz and is tiny. from reading amazon's specs: 12.0 x 14.0 x 10.0 inches ; 4.0 pound 
The product was easy to load onto my Windows based computer using Windows XP. I connected everything as instructed and as soon as I plugged in the TV cable to the back of the modem, My internet explorer picked up the signal and put me at the log in page for new accounts of my cable provider. The modem comes with both a USB and 100T ethernet adapter port, so use whatever way works best for you. I tried them both and they appear to work at the same speed. I am guessing it all depends on the speeds your cable provide is delivering. Amazon had the best price on the product if you have the time to wait for their free shipping. I ordered some stuff from them in the past and the free shipping seemed to take forever. You may want to factor in paying the additional cost for shipping when buying this product if you need it right away. The price, even with the additional shipping charge is still a little less expensive than Best Buy. The cost difference between buying it at a Best Buy store and Amazon online will not be much, and you'll have to wait a few days to have it in your hands, but you get to avoid the drive to the store. I went this route, paid the extra shipping and waited for my package to arrive. If time is not an issue, then use the free shipping method and you will discover that Amazons Price can't be beat, it is the lowest price anywhere. 
When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since. I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour? Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit.. 
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know. I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac. I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened. I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor. It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website. They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive). I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it. I'm upset. Any advice 
Like other people here my lock spontaneously changed its combination on me....Surprise! My laptop is currently locked up at my desk at work which ruined my day and is ruining my night. Another stressor I do not need to deal with...do not get this lock if you value the mobility of your laptop over a theft deterrant 
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that? Now I can't use it at all.... I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now. Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products. Buyers beware... 
I did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse. I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable. At home, I use a Wacom tablet. Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington. Wireless was key for portability. I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out. I received it today, and I'm on my first charge. So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway). - I have large but skinny hands. Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers. Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size. - I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4). Excellent Bluetooth connection. Also very good response, very little delay. Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position. It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. - USB charger works well. The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse. - As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge. Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers. Once I figured it out, not so hard. Overall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me. I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe 
I just purchased the HP DVD740e from costco, and burned the CDR disc came with drive. The lightscribe worked really well, it was the first experience, so I came here for reviews on DVDR, I was told that the Verbatim is of top quality and the lightscribe picture is even better than the HP's, so I purchased the Verbatim 30pk, received today. I was so excited, that I immediately burn two discs with the best setting, but both come out fuzzy and presented the "out of focus" dull feel, look terrible with no detail compared to the HP bonus disc. Is this a joke? This is my first Amazon review, can't help to vent my disappointment. Thanks for the super fast shipping anyway. 
I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple's part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it. It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it's still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press "next" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes. Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod "family" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that's how much I love it! For having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it's amazing! 
I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous. I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so! I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move. Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though. Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun 
Have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you "an arm and a leg"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they're just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables. Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there's really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you'd see between any other "cheap" versus "designer" cables on the market. But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that's worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn't just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn't doubt if they're certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you're looking at the right cables. But for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables 
I received it today, and it's a monster. If you've seen one in a store, it looks twice as big on your desk. Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT. After doing online research about using the 30" display under Windows XP, I found that the "functional" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors). Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try. Besides, I didn't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2). To my great relief, the monitor worked on the card right away, even showing me the POST and Windows start-up screen (it did for the 20" displays, too). But to my absolute delight, the card is actually running both the 30" and a 20" in 32-bit color. The 20" looks absurdly small next to the 30", like I didn't water it enough or something. The 30" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved! Maybe I'm just sitting too close. The only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20" plug to fit it below the 30". I'm not a gamer, so I can't say whether the card performs well for that. It feels as zippy as with the 20" on regular windowing tasks. I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff. The screen had a slight warm cast that I didn't like. Nvidia's control panel let me adjust it manually, and now my 30" and 20" look almost identical. My biggest fear was of course dead pixels. By the good grace of lucky ducks, this is the third panel I've gotten from Apple with no dead pixels. Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges. It's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it. In any case, I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once, and it does a fine job at that. I'm using the 20" for browsing and, alas, a few panels that STILL don't fit. Apple, where's 3840 x 2400?? I strip one star cuz it's crazy expensive. 
Pluged it in and good to go, I skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that... went to the admin screen, a little overwhelmed with ALL the features, it could be more stremlined, for a novice user they would be entirely lost, perhaps that is whats on the install disk (easier setup), but my experience self, got through just fine, enabled the maximum security features (more so then the easy setup button, which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments). Heard lots of issues, was weary, but out of the box works great, no issues, no dropped connections. And for that reason, since it works I do NOT intend to flash the firmware to the latest, as the saying goes if it isnt boke don't fix it. BTW home network is a mix of print server, wired PC, wireless Apple powerbook, everything running smoothly 
For the most part, I do find HP ink to be the best. However, every now and then a new ink cartridge is bad. One of the colors doesn't print for some reason. My opinion is that these ink cartridges are just too expensive to be getting any bad ones 
The first card I received was defective. Even after formatting it in a camera, the image files could not be transferred to any of 3 computers with 2 different O/Ses via USB cable to the camera or card reader. I'm waiting on a replacement. Hope it works 
The Antenna did not work at all! Save your money! 
I found this keyboard to be very helpful. I am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers. While my laptop can be used to type, when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable. This keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing. The bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if I would like without stopping the connection. I would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it. Overall, a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier 
I use it for my Zen MicroPhoto and it does not work at all. It has the lowest battery life, used it for twenty mintues and it started to get worse and worse. There is no possible way of getting rid of the static unless you are the MP3 player below the transmitter, which is obviously dangerous while driving. You can only tune it to four stations which are 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7 which is absolutely pointless approach to an FM transmitter. I seriously regret every buying this transmitter 
It's partly my fault, of course. I bought this to use on my motorcycle. I thought the small size, especially the flat body, would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag. I also bought a special handlebar mount for it. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with it. It's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes. Whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle, it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route. Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only. The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive (at least, not for me), Worse still, it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes. The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time. Not very helpful. My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle. They should probably just stick to GPS. 
I hate this contraption and I stupidly let 30 days pass before I realized how much I hate it. Now I start every morning with a "boy I hate this thing." Why? well here are few reasons why: You cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18" and to get a backlight you must depress "any button"---not a bad idea but horribly executed. The backlight lasts four seconds--way too fast in the night and "any button" is a lie because you can't press "stop" nor the "on" for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then, in the dark, have to figure out how to terminate. The cd player spends more time "reading" your cd than it does playing it. The "tuner/band" button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to, the screech of a not tuned in AM station happens way too often. The worst of it all was I called Eton to tell them how much I hated it, just thought they might want to know. I had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something, but first she wanted me to talk to the engineer/designer. So I waited a week for him to return my call and he was quite rude saying if there is nothing wrong with it (everything is wrong, but they don't count that) there is nothing they can do. He offered to trade mine for a different one just the same and I said "why bother." It was a classic story of "I made it so it is by definition without errors--now leave me alone,just buy it and be thrilled with my brilliant design 
I was delighted with my ToughSkin for all of two hours. That's how long it took for the belt clip to break, rendering my new purchase worthless to me. The ToughSkin itself is rugged; I loved it. I should have waited before buying it, though ... on my last visit to an Apple dealership, they had a bin full of *just the ToughSkins,* for sale at a discount. When I asked about these, I was told, "The belt clips break, and customers bring the ToughSkins back." I should note I'm very careful with my IPod and accessories. I'm not rough on them. The clip just fell apart while I was walking down the street. Given other comments about the flimsy clips, this is clearly a design issue that Speck Products needs to address 
A lot cheaper than model-specific docking stations, and 'does what it says on the tin'. Quite stylish too, as docking stations go 
Works as advertised, have not had a single problem with it since installing it in my Tungsten T 
We used this charger with a DC inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a Sony DSC-H5 camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges. The 2700mAh battery is great 
This phone is really cool but it has two major flaws. The first is the caller ID problem which the other posts have already described in som detail. The second is that although the incoming volume is fine, the people on the other end have trouble hearing me and say that i sound 'far away and very soft'. Troubleshooting and reseting doesn't seem to help. Will return ASAP 
The cigarette lighter adapter (with speaker) is really bad quality, the original one worn out within 1 year, I purchased a new adapter and worn out within 6 month. Garmin need to do better 
I bought these headphones based on the first couple of reviews I read here. I should have read further, because about two weeks after I purchased the earphones, the left side went out completely. There was nothing obvious on the outside of the unit and I didn't hear any "rattling" as described by other users. The darn things just quit! I must say, however, that the sound quality for those first two weeks was excellent, but all in all, not worth the money and frustration 
As others have reported, my latch broke as well, but I broke it within three days of ownership. Within a month, I cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when I was removing it from the case to sync it. At the time, the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable. Bought a Rhinoskin to replace this. Look elsewhere before you purchase this one 
To avoid burning a coaster, update the firm ware on your dual layer compatable drive first ([...]). The Verbatim discs seem to have fewer compatability problems than the other brands I've tried. If your home DVD player is not dual layer compatable, you may experience some problems. It's normal for the movie to stop momentarily when it switches to the second layer. For best results with movies, I burn these as slow as possible. For data storage, they will burn at 8X no problem. These discs work as advertised. If you're torn between Verbatim and another brand, I would opt for Verbatim discs. They really do work the best 
I really love my Garim GPS 12. It is easy to use and move between screens and features. The Summit is not as easy to use. It is not as convenient to identify way points, does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple. It was not a step up but sideways. I use it in conjunction with my GPS 12 mostly just to keep the track log 
Easy enough to pop off the normal ant (RoadMate 700) and pop on this magmount version... and what a difference it made! Signals really are remarkedly improved. **HIGHLY** suggested for folks in hilly areas to nearly guarentee you'll get the birds 
I bought this to replace an Epsom printer that refused to print accurate color, and an old Canon scanner. I am very, very pleased! It looks terrific (my daughter said, "Wow, cool new printer!"). Set up was easy. And the printing is fast and absolutely beautiful, even in draft mode. Better yet, the cartridges are much cheaper than my Epson ones. Scanning is easy and good, too. I don't use fax, so can't rate that function. Overall, I am thrilled with this printer. It was well worth the $180 
I bought this because my windshield suction mount could not be trusted. I've had it fall off more than once. Then you drive around wondering if your $700 Nuvi is going to fall and break. Not Fun! The friction mount works for me. For everyday driving, even aggresive driving, it stays put. Someone on this site left feedback about using it with their Nuvi 360 and I used their review to make the purchase. I'm glad I did. 
This receiver is a replacement for an older, more expensive, defective Sony that I had. It was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units. I am satisfied with the product 
I have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new iPod. All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all. But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course! And man- they still have it. These aren't the greatest phones I've ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more. Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*. They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick. These sound nice, full- the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth. And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue. Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I've ever owned! My bottom line- anyone who doesn't grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane. Period *g 
I am not using this Microphone, the cord from the back of my computer barely reaches. Uncomfortable to lean so far forward 
the connection keeps coming loose and now it doesnt work unless you hold it in place - useless and a waste of mone 
I recently bought this keyboard to go along with a fancy ergonomic laptop stand. The stand puts the laptop screen at a reasonable height for use on a desktop -- that works great. The keyboard, however, is fairly awful, and I'm returning it. I realize I shouldn't expect much for $20, but the keyboard has an exceptionally soft, mushy feeling. The "comfort type" slanted keys didn't get in my way, but they didn't help anything, either. The worst part about this keyboard, however, was that it uses a non-standard layout. Look closely at the right side -- the "enter" key is oversized, and the |\ key is moved below to accomodate it, with the consequence that the right shift key is miniaturized. This, for a shell user or programmer, is awful. When you need to pipe something, or escape the next character, you really don't mean to be hitting return instead. And with the small right shift key, even typing properly with balanced use of the keyboard is difficult. This small design decision makes this keyboard terrible for heavy computer users like me 
I've never written a review, but I've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers, so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review. I know experience and taste vary by individual, but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint. Pros: - Bluetooth - connects immediately; provides smooth accurate tracking - Size - very portable; some may find it too narrow; I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse - Battery life - I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I'm a fairly heavy user - USB charge attachment - allows you to continue to work while recharging - Product Design/Quality - Nicely engineered; good quality material- not tinny - it's built to take abuse Cons: - Haven't really found any - It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line (I don't tend to do that) then I realized it was pretty straight forward. If you're looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one. 
Kit completo para colocar una peque�a red inal�mbrica casera, sin problemas. Sencillo de instalar, tanto que cualquier bolsa sin experiencia puede hacerse con este kit. Tiene se�al fuerte, sin atenuaciones. Saludo 
I've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull. First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries. Pretty simple, huh? Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%. I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it 
I bought this and found that if you like to burn your own CD's to play in it, it has a problem reading the tracks. It sometimes spins up and doesn't play, and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find. I usually wake to that sound before the music starts. I AM NOT A LIGHT SLEEPER. This is my second one, and I've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months. Do yourself a favor and find a different product 
My family and I just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while. When I saw the Microsoft LifeCam at Target stores and that it was compatible with Windows Live I thought it would be worth the $100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family. I purchased the software and started the installation process on my computer. Just so you know,my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active USB 2.0 connections, only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard, mouse, and this webcam, along with 512MB of RAM which is more than necessary for this product to function. The software took about 10 minutes to install which I thought was a little odd, then it askes for you to plug in the camera. My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly. I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result. I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem. Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub, ports, etc. and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly. I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software (this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice). By now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera. I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic, but it said that there was no camera attached. I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results. For the price paid and the 3+ hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it. I will be returning it to Target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand. As someone else said earlier in the reviews, "does microsoft ever send their products through Quality Assurance before they release them? 
Wow...just got one of these at a great price, hooked it up to my Mac G4 via a DVID cable, and it boots up at native resolution (1680 x 1050) automatically - no muss, no fuss. Text is crisp and clean 
This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse. When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use 
I ordered this web cam because I wanted one of the better web cams on the market. I was NOT able to get it working. I returned it. Very dissapointed 
Great DVD/VCR combo but does not play DVD's from other region. Does not have an eject button on the remote either. If u have DVD's, VCD from other countries that you would be playing I do not recommed this player 
I bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2-line phone with answering capability. Turns out, I cannot keep it, due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me. The good: it's nice looking, compact, has good sound, and has a selection of cute little ringtones. The bad: This machine WILL NOT RECORD INCOMING MESSAGES SILENTLY. It broadcasts both the OGM and the ICM being left by the caller through the speaker. There is no way I know of to defeat this. You can turn the volume down from loud to medium loud, but you cannot set the machine to record messages silently, in the background. Do you think you might ever not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your recorder? Would you ever want to sleep without being disturbed by the sound of incoming messages? Then this one isn't for you. Mine is for sale. 
No way am I purchasing this for my iPod. I would love to be able to charge my iPod away from my iMac, but I refuse to purchase this. This should of been included in the box. It is a tremendous ripoff to buy an AC adapter seprately (and at $30), but then again, I'm sure Apple is making a ton off of this gimic, but I refuse to contribute. I can see not including a dock, A/V cables, etc, as those aren't essential iPod accessories. But an AC adapter? Come on. Bad Apple. Bad! On the plus side, this AC adapter is smaller and comes with an iPod to charger (or iPod to computer) cable, which the previous model did not include. It's still a ripoff, though 
I bought this print server back in December 2005. I used it with my All-in-One Brother printer MFC-4800. The installation was easy. It worked great......for 4 months. Then...then... it just stoped working after 4 months. I tried to disconnect and reconnect the power, Ethernet cable etc...nothing helped. May be I just got a bad product 
After two months, this phone stopped working. It was returned to Panasonic Repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in 6-8 weeks. This is not customer service. Panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone. When called today to check on status of order, answer was basically "tough luck." Never again, Panasonic. Amazon should discontinue this brand 
For my PowerBook - my first bluetooth mouse (a macally bt) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk. So for the replacement I read the reviews and went with the Kensington bluetooth mini - primarily for the on/off functionality. I like the size and shape, the on/off switch and the scroll works just keen. However, tracking is a nightmare - especially when CPU usage is high (applications like Photoshop, Acrobat or using a VPN to access my work files). I tried troubleshooting, adjusting the track rate, but nope. The cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse. I think I'm going to throw in the towel and go back to wired 
I have approximately 10,000 slides to scan. I purchased the 4850 and after about 3,000 slides began to get three to four dark blue lines across the image. After reporting it to HP they sent me a replacement TMA. The new TMA worked fine for the first 450 slides and then BINGO, I now am getting two dark blue lines again. I think the machine is not engineered to handle the work load I have. 
The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it 
I was on hold 50 minutes, 52 seconds before anybody answered. I heard "your call is important to us" at least 100 times, which wasn't very convincing 
I like keeping all my stuff in one place, but don't like CD folders, so these slim cases are great. I accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack, the case didn't break, and the cd was fine. All in all, a great product 
I love Belkin and their surge protectors are top quality. I specifically look for their brand and I am always very impressed. This model has been especially good to me over the last 3 years and I would highly recommend it 
I purchased two of these units the first one worked OK. The second one has a problem. In a side by side comparison the signal qualities of the two units vary. I checked there accuracy and tracking with OziExplorer moving map software. The first unit tracks pretty good, but the second units position is off a large percentage of the time and sometimes as much as 400 meters. I sent the faulty unit to Garmin to be repaired. They sent it back with a description of the problem and that it had been fixed. I checked the unit out and it is the same as when I sent it to them. Now I'm stuck with a dud 
This is a total waste of money and engineering. Plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything. Sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable FM player. Wrapping it back up and sending it back 
It also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time. I've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle (out of two that come with it) still looks almost full. If the price was a little more consumer friendly I'd give it five stars. I mean come on. When you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50-pack of CD-R's for less than $14, the profit margin on something like this is probably 200% or more 
Before you buy anything from Creative, google the words incompatible + legacy drivers + sounblaster + windows xp Huge compatibiltiy issues that will have Creative Tech help telling you to flash and update your system bios, chipsets, leaving an entire PCI slot between Sounblaster card and any other card, update drivers, yada, yada, etc. Read all of the issues from the aforementioned google, and ignore the Creative employee reviews (they are easy to spot). Creative ignores the fact that its products have huge conflicts with Windows operating systems 
Does NOT work with my Creative ZEN. Can leave plugged in overnight and it does NOT charge at all 
takes a little time to start operating, very good for the price a little trouble using it inside ca 
At first, I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise. Pros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting system Cons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that's why I give 4 stars 
The cheapest option I found at the time but an excelent pen drive. Small and with a good style 
i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations. it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes. after 3 conversations with canon customer care, we decided it was not the printer, but the cheaper ink. i switched back to canon, bit the bullet on the price, and everything is fine. i found decent prices on amazon, particularly at eek industries 
This remote will do everything you need or want. Simple to use and great customer service. I had a couple of "glitches" (buttons that didn't work quite right) when I first programmed the device, but the Harmony support team helped me through those areas. The changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the Harmony web site so if I ever need to, all I have to do is reload the info. Like another reviewer, I also have a TiVO (2 actually) and the only button that wouldn't work on my Harmony 680 was the "clear" button. Customer service fixed that in a jiffy, too. I have owned several multiple device remotes over the years and never had one so good that I could really put away all my other remotes. I now only use one - the Harmony 680. Fantastic device! I'd give it 6 stars if I could 
This set lost color and picture quality over the few months that I owned it and then it just stopped working. I'm going to buy something else and so should you 
After having my old phone for 40 years I bought a new NWB phone due to remodeling. It lasted 5 months. You cannot get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail. Buy a NWB phone at your own risk. I had to buy another phone--ATT and it works fine 
Bought this as a back-up for the internal hard drive of the laptop. My experience was sadly similar to many others on this site. Worked fine for two backups, then the drive stopped being recognized by my own or any other computer. Little red "power" light is on, little disc whirls around, but no blue "data transmit" light appears anymore. These are clearly a dismally unreliable and poorly made product- just imagine the disaster if this occurred when you were trying to restore data to a corrupted hard drive on your primary machine. A free replacement would not be much of a compensation. Avoid!! 
These speakers are unusable. They give off horrible feedback even when there's not a cell phone or cordless phone in the room 
From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal "automatic" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2. So I called back again. And again. And again. Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person. Install from CD. Reboot. etc. It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort. I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card! I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650. Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news. I give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless. Back it goes 
All ports began running slow after just 6 months of use. Followed LinkSys RMA process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake. I followed yet another LinkSys RMA process and had to wait TWO MONTHS for the replacement switch covering their mistake. The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues 
I had been wanting a nice color GPS unit for a while. My wife purchased this one for me and I love it. I purchased the City Select Maps to use with the autoroute system. It would be nice if the maps were included with unit. I've had it out on several caching trips now and it hasn't let me down yet. Make sure you take the time to read through the instruction book so you will know how to use the many features that the unit has built-in 
I was looking for something suitable to house my sansa, and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb, looking sharp, snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way, I suppose, it wouldn't be able to fall off 
I've been using these Memorex CD-Rs for years and have no problems with their reliability. Have used them with multiple CD and DVD burners without compatibility issues. This was another re-order and I continue to be happy with this product 
I've gone thru multiple revisions of firmware, and multiple calls to D-Link support, and this piece of junk still does not work with the D-Link DWL-G700AP. D-Link support calls are worthless. As a computer professional, I find it appalling that D-Link would introduce and continue to sell this product, which clearly does not operate correctly. 
Got it and plugged it into my IPod and there was a major incompatibility. The screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the IPod but when I went to record I received an error message that the IPod could not locate a microphone. Perhaps an IPod problem? The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated. I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis. Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod???? 
After having two SanDisk card readers, and one LaCie card reader die on me, I invested in this Lexar card reader. For the money, it has worked flawlessy with Pro compact flash cards up to 4GB in size. I am very impressed with the transfer speeds, and the unit is not too big for traveling. The door that covers the slot, however, is very flimsy and easily deattaches (but fortunately easily reattaches too?) I use Mac OS X 10.4.8 and it works just fine. I also used it with Windows XP without any installation or transfer issues 
I needed new computer speakers after my Cyber Acoustics died after only 3 months. SO i wasn't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast. I use a Mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers, but couldn't decide to go with either the Sound Sticks, Creatures, or these. Well since i am saving up for a new Laptop, i wanted to save as much money as possible. Plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they STILL work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance. Well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to Max and Sub base up to Max. (Yes i underestimated these speakers) When i turned a song in in iTunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair! I was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume, and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk! Moral one: Do not underestimate speakers my good brands even with low wattage. I highley suggest these speakers for people who don't have much to spend or don't want to spend alot of money. If you want better quality i would go with Sound sticks or Creatures. But these look like they will serve me well 
compared this cable to a philips performance component cable and i am not impressed it was the exact same in picture quality. all your paying for is the name.. why spend 50$ when you can spend 20$ on the philps and get the same thing? 
I loved this speaker system when I got it last year. But in the last few months it developed a loud humming noise that makes it so you can not hear your music. Very disapointed 
I received the camera and was not happy when I found a cheap mic that was attached to the cord of an ear peace instead of the the superior sound mic advertised in the ad. I called Amazon, they had no appolgies and said the most they could do was refund my money. On another note the picture quality was ok but froze at least 2 times or better per use, as for sound I had to put the mic up to my mouth before the person on the other end could hear me. Not very happ 
I have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of over-the-head headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price 
Much cheaper than other Sony machine. Works fine -- then again, I wasn't looking for anything fancy. Don't have problems with the speakerphone or message recording as the others did. I like the dual keypads 
I had a previous good experience with a Jabra headset. This one was recommended for my Panasonic cordless phone by Jabra. However, the sound quality is terrible. It lacks any kind of high frequency response, and so sounds very boomy and full of bass, making it almost impossible to use. It also needs a foam cover, since any kind of slight wind movement makes it extremely noisy. I contacted Jabra about this product, but received no response. Maybe it would work better with a different phone, but definitely NOT with my Panasonic 
The first subwoofer died (no sound) after 6 days. Remember, the sub powers all the speakers in this system. I sent it back to the company I bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of "Klipsch's faulty product". They asked me if I would like a refund and like an idiot I said, "No, just send me another one". The replacement Klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then NOTHING. No power from the sub! Same problem but now my warranty is up. Klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty. Shame on Klipsch for making such a shoddy product. Shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice. Heed all these warnings my friends. I would buy used speakers at a garage sale before I would buy another Klipsh product. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! 
After using this sd card only twice, it can not be recognized by any of my card reader. Totally a waste of money and time. Do not buy pny brand 
I was looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, long lasting, and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though. The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter 
Corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days. My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages, mobile phone down for whatever reason, etc. This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in. The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc. Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen. Highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house 
Sound great. Nice bank for the buck. Did the I-plop follower think they would fit inside his ear? Maybe he is bitter with the DRM and I-Tune scam that Job's is screwing people over with. He's worse than Microsoft. I "love" followers

Bought one from Amazon, they sat on the order for a week before shipping a unit that arrived dead. Went through the return/replacement process and they sat on the order for over a week this time and the that one arrived dead with the exact same failure mode. The second one looked as if it had been opened before, accessory bag not sealed, manuals out of place, interior packaging worn. I believe the second one they sent was a return that was then resent to me. Bad news!!! I still had both and in hope of fixing on, I contacted Garmin who said they were indeed broken and offered to fix one and send it back. This would mean I'd have paid full price for what would then be a refurbished unit. Both of them returned. I needed the unit right away for a desert trip. Amazon's refund process made it such that they'd not refund all of the funds but hold them on account (those that were originally given to me as a gift certificate from my employer). Therefore I could not get the equipment for a local vendor. I opened one month nearly to the day dealing with slow order processing, bad units, and more. So, I'd not recommend the unit and I think Amazon may need to review their own practices to ensure what they have in inventory is new and likely operational, and that when a customer orders something, they put in the effort to ship it ASAP!! Without that, if you have to buy one, go to a local dealer, put that batteries in at that shop and have them prove it works before you leave with it. Since you can't so that here, don't buy it here. 
I love this keyboard. After searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I'm so glad that I chose this one. It is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It's a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use. They keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don't use it much. It's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though. I really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don't like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can't see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard. Aside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it. To top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability 
We have been unsuccessful with this e-reader attachment since we purchased it. Cards read once and never again. Doesn't matter if we use the GB SP or Advance. Still doesn't do anything. Don't recommend you waste your money 
I have had two of these units. I would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ML-300. Save yourself some money and get something else. Both of the units lasted only 14 months. I did hardly any typing with them. Only multi-page forms and applications. The printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys. Took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing. Contacted Brother International USA and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months. Save yourself some money and buy a Big Chief table and a number 2 pencil. 
I had this in my computer for a month, with a satellite radio on the audio-in and speakers on the line out. It started crackling and the audio was distorted after a few weeks. I took the SB out and went back to the motherboard onboard audio and it worked fine. Conclusion = Sound Blaster suck 
I have a dishnetwork 942 HDTV DVR system. This antenna is designed for a much older system. It doesn't fit the dish very easily and was difficult to secure. I can't tell if it works because so far it just seems to be incompatible with my system 
The sound range and clarity is quite good, they are comfortable. My only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes, I'd like to use it with my computer not a MP3 attached to my belt 
I purchased my first Roadmate in August 2004. Since then I have taken it to various places in North America. It's gotten me out of some tight spaces. I've never gotten lost while using it. I purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed. I sent it in for repair. (The extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier) The new RoadMate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since. The old Roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week. I gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since. Pros: Easy to use. Amazing detail. Cons: Sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellites Original mount is useless after about a month. I got aftermarket tripod for each unit and they seem to work fine. Software updates are expensive. 
This is an excellent buy and is a quality item. The service was fast and the card works as expected 
I spoke with customer service rep at 800-283-1311. Devices have a one-year warranty. I stated that I sent in the Registration card, and asked if she would look up the purchase date. She said no, "Registration and Warrany are in different departments." She asked me to hold, and came back on the line stating that since this model originally sold in 2003, my unit went off warranty in 2004 unless I have the invoice. I called back about an hour later, after finding the invoice, and got the same customer service rep. She recognized me and belittled me for calling back and said unless I have a question, there's nothing they can do. I stated that I found the invoice as requested and she asked me to fax it to her. I did that, so far no response. We'll see if they replace the unit or not. Just an FYI...after the one-year warranty, there are no options. The do not offer parts or service after the one-year warranty 
I type medical reports for a living, up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week. Without the wrist rest, my wrists would not be able to hold up. The wrist rest is the perfect size. It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can't smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I'd give this 4-1/2 stars 
Happy with the three tips included, I decided to try these for the heck of it. While they go nicely and comfortably deep into the ear and don't dare come out until you intend for them to, for some reason, they diminish the quality of the sound greatly. I can most closely describe it as the sound of overcompressed MP3s. They took nearly all of the clarity out of the music 
Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also. The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL 
I had DCS-900W from the same product line. It craped out after 9 months, and now I am on the fifth call to try to resolve the issue and get it shipped back. I don't know where their support is located, but the line quality is very bad, they ran the same drill over and over, but just don't want to issue you an order for you to ship back. This is the first D-Link product I own and probably the last. The resolution looks crappy even when it's new, and now it's totally dead, even reset won't work on it 
After only a couple of months of light use, the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working. As soon as power is connected to the sub woofer, the loud thumping starts. I exchanged the system and the second set had the same problem after 6 weeks!! A total piece of junk 
the razor diamondback is awsome no problems with install. and great sensetivity when doing everything 
These speakers are o.k., but don't expect high sound quality (I bought these as refurbs, so maybe that is it, but when you turn up the volume, they don't sound good - I'd recommend going to a store and testing units before buying new). Also, probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is, they fade in and out when you walk around the room. This should not be a problem on this low bandwidth (but it is), perhaps the antenna needs a boost 
This is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot. If I leave my laptop somewhere I hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad. This is really small and compact! Perfect for traveling too. I've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem...it still recoils well 
1st the ipod is expensive. It should at least come with a protective cover. 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym. Quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called "disk mode" which freezes the unit up and cant be played. Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze. Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happe 
I bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint. I use it in Chicago. A lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal, not true at all. I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds. It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.) But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna. Overall, this GPS works perfectly. The auto-reroute is fantastic, it is very quick to recalculate my route if I miss a turn, and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn. You will not be disappointed with this purchase 
The system worked out of the box allowing me to quickly link up additional devices in an in-home office which had a single network connection. Haven't measured simultaneous throughput to multiple computers yet, but from simple observation connectivity seems transparent. Should allow for movement to gigabit switching in the future as well 
I like the Dish Networks technology and the potential that it could be. One DVR which covers two rooms is great. The picture is clear when it works. The menus/programming are intuitive. The pricing is reasonable. But, my complaint is RELIABILITY and SUPPORT...for the two years I have had Dish my TV picture seems to go out every 6 months or so. Everytime I talk to Dish customer service I get a different reason why it could be out. Several times I have gotten new DVR boxes mailed to me and there is always a dispute about who should pay. Several times I have had Dish Net come out to my house and they have always tried to make me pay until I told them I'm tired of the hassel and just cancel me. Now my dish is out again this weekend and I am missing the Ohio State / Michigan game because my TV says no Dish Signal (reason tbd). Anyway, if it worked consistently as advertised I would give it 4 or 5 stars. But due to reliability I give it 2 stars. And with Murphy's Law it always goes down when you want to watch that big event (prompting me to write this review instead of watching the game today)!! I may have to switch back to cable. - J.Clark / San Jose, CA 
Bought these and used them once. Had to remove them when I found myself in dire need of some Excedrin Migraine. What do you get for your $39? Cheap, tinny, bass-less sound that's like being plugged into a busted Walkman. The buds themselves don't remain stable in the ear, so forget about using them while engaging in motion-involved activity (such as jogging, walking, head-bobbing, neck movement, etc). These are by far the worst earbuds on the market. How could Apple stoop so low? Don't be fooled! Do a Google search for these and you'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product. You've been warned. I used to use Koss Earbuds, which were pretty good. I sold these iPod duds in favor of the XtremeMac In-Ear Headphones, which are the best ones available and worth the extra money 
got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it -100 good thing i could return it 
I've owned these Altec's for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies! SOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you'll find in any speaker VOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it COMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment CONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer's controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments SIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy PRICE --- believe me - it's a bargain at under $200!!! Overall, I give my full recommendation here -- you'll love these speakers 
It would seem, even to a non-tech, that someone has switched your Uniden mobile/base tech. data around. Secondly, terms such as standard mean less than trustworthy when applied to sensitivity and selectivity. Please don't feel I berate these 2 fine products.However as I am a com/tech. I would like the actual bench test measurements for an informed recom/purchases.Also I would like to know If Cobra 1000 or 2000 series are availible as they still have the best selectivity and sensitivity that I have had on my bench yet.Thank Yo 
I really enjoyed my Zen, when it worked. The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop. So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space. I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days. Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems. It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it 
A $10 cable does the same thing. Do not believe the hype. Monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it. Its digital, 1s and 0s. Either it reads it or it doesnt. 
I bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk...I WAS TOTALLY WRONG!!! These are great, they give the bass right where you want it. Sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much. Watch out these come on sale instores for around $8.00 sometimes. That's where i got my 1st pair 
Works well with Canon 10D, 30D, and S40. Fairly fast write speed. And 4GB - pretty big (1600 JPGs in the 30D!) 
I have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C-01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month). PROS It works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone. Easy to set up. CONS Once in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again. You need a computer. In summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype Wi-Fi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out; or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router 
I was hoping that by getting this I'd get a decent flow of air and i'd be able to use it anywayer. But I was sorely dissappointed. It doesn't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel... plus its too loud to use in most places... If you really need it, you can get it... but I can't use mine often because like I said its too loud. Not worth it, not enough air flowing 
I am a typical college student, I am not a photgrapher to be or anything, so this digital card was perfect for me. I get about 330 pictures on my second best setting and have never come close to taking that many pictures. I believe this card is great for anyone who is not obessed with taking pictures, or to someone who loads them on quickly. : 
The features, size, and design of this unit are what drew me in. But after just a few uses, I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive, but completely unusable package. To start with, the unit is small - the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second, the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So, when it crashes, which it does frequently, there is no way to "cold-boot" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then, what you have is a paperweight. Oh, and by the way, when you do have it plugged in to charge, the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either. But, all of this aside, the firmware simply does not work. It locks up incessantly and, with no way to reboot, you literally have to unplug it, wait for it to auto-power-off, and hope that you can start the machine up again. And, to add insult to injury, the body is a cheap Chinese-made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones. Overall, don't be taken in by the low price. Paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that doesn't work 
This is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality 
Too much static with snapping and popping - even after making all of the adjustments possible. The speakers are ONLY 10 feet away from the transmitter but still poor-to-marginal sound quality. Don't see how these could work 300 feet away(?) I do NOT recommend this product 
These speakers are great for the common traveller and have great clean music. the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it doesn;t fofill the height of volume I wished. It is pretty loud, but I like really loud. I do not own this but one of my friends does I hoe to get logi3 i station for my ippod it seems awsome according to the reviews 
Well the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price, and Amazon.com has beaten every on-line price I have seen. As for the toner itself, Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two reasons, 1. It's what fits in my printer, and 2. I know when I buy the C3906A, I am getting what I payed for, a quality cartrige that lasts. One last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old one is finished 
I don't normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product. You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs. The quick start guide is just that "quick" and well planned. The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice. The setup diagram is excellent. The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go. One touch record starts immediately. The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly. You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide. If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won't be disappointed 
I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman 
I installed the board and my PC (running XP Pro) won't boot. I tested all the PCI slots with other cards (and mixed them up too) and the PC boots fine. I returned the card and got a new one. Same problem. I removed all of my other PCI cards and left this one in there alone ... same problem. I'm speechless. I guess it's not compatable with some systems. By the way, I know my set-up is fine. I have 3 PCI slots filled and 3 additional USB devices and all is well. I never had a problem like this before 
I have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them, and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. The Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece. The Bad: Nothing is actually "bad" about them, but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. Other Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I'm not using it, because you can forget it's there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug. I bought mine at Target, where they were labelled $24.99, on "clearance" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another "clearance" price), I bought a second pair as a backup. I'm glad I did -- I'm still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don't know how many hours I get, but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day, listening to podcasts and audiobooks 
3 more of the useless flimsy holders you get in the IPod box! 
I purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you'll know when they're calling without picking up the handset. Talking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it's a sales pitch or a call that could wait. I set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. The phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. One suggestion to make the batteries last longer: Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays "recharge" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You'll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so 
I started out with 2 gigabytes. And then after I had filled this card with about 500 photos, I downloaded all the photos to my computer. After deleting all of the photos from this card, the capacity had suddenly decreased to only half! What happened to the other 1 gigabyte? I'm sure they pre-formatted this card to appear like it's 2 gigabytes, but what a surprise when you start using it. Not good 
So far it has been terrific. Radio and downloads are easy to sort out and use. Downloading was hard, but I finally got it. The sound quality is the best thing, however. It is better than my big stereo. Napster doesn't do this mp3 however 
I had originally bought a Linksys, without doing any research beforehand... thinking all routers were more or less equal... oops! Hardware was poor, the interface was wonky, customer service was a joke. I was re-booting it every few minutes under moderate usage, because it keep dropping my DSL connection or completely locking up. I just replaced it with a DGL-4300 based on all the positive reviews, and have been very happy so far. I don't need or use any of the advanced features for gaming; but already I've been very impressed with the DGL-4300 since it hasn't dropped any connections since I bought it last week. You get what you pay for 
at such low price, this player is really pretty good. it gets the job done, even though the UI is a little bit basic. it can record in DVD+R and DVD-R, and has a 10 hour mode. Although in the 10 hour mode, image is not so clear but still pretty good if view on the computer using 320 x 240 resolution. and at such a low price, you can get two or three to record different programs and archive some shows, and it is still cheaper than the Media Center PC. Good thing is the disc is already a DVD playable in any player. No need to burn it as opposed to if you are using Tivo or Media Center PC. 
I just use the keyboard like a business user. I don't use the media stuff. I really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works. I like that it's not huge and doesn't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that I never use. The rechargeable mouse is handy as well. Prior to this, I had two Microsoft wireless combos in a row, and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me. I don't know if it's because it's Logitech or it's bluetooth, but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired (after they "wake up"). 
I am the owner of a home day care and I had all of the kids bring in T-shirts so that we could all create our own unique father's day gifts with these iron-on transfers. When I say that I followed the directions Precisely I am not fooling! I was so concerned about slip ups that I made sure I followed the directions to the letter, but every time I tried to pull off the cooled transfer paper off came half of the design and the rest styed on the paper! Very disappointing 
I ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?. Easily enough, as it turns out. I was unable to load it and control the play lists. Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop. Dragging a folder to the device was pointless. Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place. I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from "My Computer" on the host system. After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb. Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. Using Media Player to sync did no better. Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop. A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on. After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit. The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job. This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons. Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it. I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well. As it stands, it's without merit as a player. 
...what it has that the xr55 does not: HDMI, dual-amping of front mains now available during 5.1 playback, one extra set of component inputs, and all-channel stereo (called "party mode" on other receivers). Otherwise the internal components are identical, so expect similar performance---in other words, outstanding SQ when matched with the right speakers, blows away all other receivers under five hundred bucks and most under a thousand. See my lengthy review of the xr55 for more details. Boutique audio shops do not want you to know about this product, because it'd put them out of business...they make much higher margins selling you receivers costing several times this Panasonic's prices, since their profits are usually a fixed percentage of the street price. 
I purchased the pouch the carring case shortly after. I own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the go.The case holds the GPS, mount and all the different cables.The foam insert holds the GPS while still in the pouch or without.The velcro staps hold the mount the ac cord.This way when you are looking for it,everthing is in one place.The case is made well and very plain looking on the outside,so not to draw any attention 
When it works, this mouse is simply wonderful. Small, accurate, easy to recharge, easy to carry. Under those conditions, it's probably my favorite mouse. I've found that it's equally good for both Mac and Windows. One complaint is that when it's tethered to the USB port for recharging, it works nominally, but becomes very slow and awkward. It's not at all the same behavior as seen when it's completely free to move. My first incarnation of mouse lived a long life of about 10 months. My second incarnation of mouse, however, just died at the tender age of 4 months. I've attempted mouse-to-mouse resuscitation, but to no avail, having found that Iogear technical support exists by name only. I have sent multiple requests for help, and have received not a single answer. Both mice died identical deaths. Suddenly it stops being able to hold a charge, and freezes after about 5 minutes of use. Even when tethered to the USB port for a recharge it freezes. I'm sad that a technologically good product should have such terrible quality assurance in its manufacture. And such terrible customer support in dealing with its lack of QA 
I found out the way to copy photos from my CompactFlash card onto the iPAQ. It's not hard but more complex than necessary. I also found out how to send the iPAQ in to have its screen replaced. A hassle. Its screen and/or stylus should work together so they don't produce scratches in the first place 
I wanted to thank amazon for their quick response to my first order not arriving. within a week they sent me another. I have been using it everyday, and have not gotton lost. I install wood flooring in NJ PA NY, works like a charm. I use it with my palm treo 700P. 
I like this unit. It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box, and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good; I'm very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I've not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. All told, I'd recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation 
Those people giving these speakers low reviews because they don't have enough bass are idiots. I don't know what people expect of these little speakers, but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do. These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels; from Paris to camping in Northern California. I cannot imagine going everywhere without them. They are not equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be. All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers. Do not listen to the other reviews, these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player. Enjoy them anywhere 
Excellent sound from phones and microphone. Comfortable on head and ears. Plenty of cable. On cable controls are handy. 
I'm still discovering the power of this program - at least when teamed with the Garmin 60CS. Auto routing, waypoints, detailed maps, assistance in finding the nearest gas station... the list is nearly endless. I've recommended this combination to several of my friends who are also consultants and who operate in a broad geography 
I got this toy for Christmas. Ilove it. I abanded this toy,and it got some brudle hits. It was still alive! Know I keep safe becuse I don't want it to die. I don't think this toy is a wast of money.Mine is ginger. It came with a silver/grey newborn kittin 
The second disc in this package was faulty, which I did not discover until I spent two hours recording a movie. There was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd+r. Not what I expected from Memorex which purports to be the best. I have switched to Maxell 
I ordered 2 of these, realizing they would have limited adjustment range - other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel. What prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight. This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac. There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I'm sure it would be fine, but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating. 
Esactly what I was wanting. When you turn there is resistance (springs I think) and everything works great. If you use flight sims you need this product. Works awsome 
It works with all my devices, it has several outputs for your different devices, no complain with it... 
I have no complaints about this flash drive. It does what it should, is easy to use, has enough storage to backup all my digital pics from my hard drive (so far!), and is not expensive. 
When I plugged these in they worked fine for about seven minutes, then the speaker's internal power simply cut off. Happened on the AC adapter or batteries, whether I was using my computer or my iPod as the sound source. Same behavior every time. Logitech sent me a replacement from a new production run, same thing happened. Sent it back to Logitech on my nickel, got another replacement from same production run (Product ID: A612). Same problem. After two months and many long waits for Logitech tech support, I'm giving up. Maybe it was just a bad run, or maybe my environment is flukey, but I'm sorry I ever bought this thing 
I won't recommend to any body. You have the same way of charging thru your computer. I think is waste 
As of right now, I am an Apple Student Developer Most of my work comes from Filmmaking, as I'm an Independent Filmmaker, and all of my post production work relies heavily upon my Apple G5 Tower, as well as a TON of external harddrive storage While some of my LaCie HD's have worked great, many of them have simply failed me here are the pro's - 1. great interface - both FireWire 400 and 800, and they are easy to daisychain 2. they are fast - 7200 RPM, and usually, if the drive is good, the performance will show CONS - 1. very weak body ---- forget if you drop this thing even one inch - it'll be dead 2. very tough to hookup to other drives -- when I say this, I mean it is impossible to stack this drive, or try and put it in a space where it'll stay put THE BIGGEST PROBLEM --- I don't know what accounts for this - whether its the bridge or the drive itself - but LaCie's drives fail way too much I've probably purchased around 14 LaCie drives in the past 4 years, for varioius film projects and associate ones ----- of the 14, I have had 5 completely fail on me This is simply unacceptable for any drive company when you consider it all, companies like MAXTOR offer drives with the same interface, same speeds, but at a lower price with that said, take a look at MAXTOR, whose drives are housed in a very indestructive body (...) On a sidenote, LaCie has honored the warranties on their drives, and when they're open, their customer service is very helpful --- but I've lost too much data, at this point, to recommend the 
These Verbatims are terrific. As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players. Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else. Usually, you're safe with media made in Japan. These Verbatim's are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I've bought one every couple months and I'm on my 3rd spindle now. They have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200). Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos. Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly). So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) . Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs. Highly recommended...I'm ordering more! 
This machine is great looking, compact, and seems to be the perfect combination fax/answering machine/speakerphone. One major problem: The phone is well below average in sound quality, and the speaker is absolutely terrible. The tiny, poorly made speaker is placed in the back left side of the unit and and is totaly inaudible at loud volumes due to distortion. The fax is great, the print quality is great, the speed is great, but you have to lower the volume and lean over with your head against the speaker to hear messages. This problem also renders the speakerphone useless. I returned this unit twice thinking it was defective, but spoke to HP and was told that is just the way this unit works. Buy the Panasonic KX-FHD351 if you need a great sounding unit. The only problem with the Panasonic is that it doesn't come in black, but is a much better phone/answering/speakerphone. 
I use the Suctions Mount Antenna because I remove from sight whenever I leave my car which is idea for my purposes. The antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock. The only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up 
IF YOU HAVE A TEKXON DIGITAL CAMERA DO NOT GET THIS because when you put the memory card in and you turn the camera on the screen goes black! 
I bought this printer because I wanted high quality photo printing and I didn't need any of the bells and whistles that come with more expensive printers. It's a Canon, so I figured I could count on the photo quality. I was terribly disappointed though. I generally buy Staples brand photo paper for general photo printing, and it always worked fine with my Epson printer. But my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy -- like I was looking at the images though a mild but annoying grey/brown haze. So I went out and bought Canon paper instead. The quality was somewhat improved, but still not what I had expected. So yes, I got a printer for under $30, but now to get even passably OK prints, I need to spend a fortune on Canon brand inks and paper. Not much of a bargain. 
It'll do in a pinch....but I hope there are better options. At times the sound is clear, however, most of the time the static is either 1) just annoying or 2) the static is so loud and piercing that you have to turn it off. I hope there are units that broadcast a stronger signal, or have another way to connect, in order to provide a constant tolerable sound quality. I would recommend spending some more money to get a reliable device. 
I am going to strictly comment on the Linksys PAP2. A lot of the reviews on here have been for the Vonage service. The Linksys PAP2 is NOT THE Vonage service, but one of many adapters you can use. I am extreamly satisfied with my Linksys PAP2. It is small, light weight, and perfect for those who need to travel. The voice quality is excellent and people say I do not sound like I am talking over VOIP. There is no line noise, static, popping, etc. I am giving this product 4 stars. Why? Because there is only ONE ethernet port. If you have a router, just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go. If you do not have a router, consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4-port router. There are several. 
A memory Stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a Sony Camera - Fantastic 
amazon attempted to extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late 
This is about the worse thing i've ever bought for an ipod accessory. It does NOT work. All I heard was static, and very little music. If you do want to hear music, you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you'll get is static. I bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it. I was hesitant to buy it, seeing almost every review has said it doesn't work but I bought it anyway, don't buy it! Every review I've seen has negative feedback for this item, and I agree with everyone. I figured since Griffin made a new itrip, it would be better and work great. However, it is the total opposite from that. I do NOT recommend this product at all. Don't waste your time or money 
The keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling. Worse, the layout is nonstandard: they've messed up the key cluster above the arrows (Insert/Delete/Home/End/etc.). And the right hand Ctrl is not below the right end of the Shift key, it is under the left end of the Shift key, where one of the Windows keys (the context menu one) normally is. They've taken out one of the Windows menu keys, too. The wireless features worked fine (I've used it two days) and worked even without installing their driver software (something I'm always reluctant to do). I think some of the extra buttons (multimedia controls) on the keyboard don't work for me, because of this. I use the computer it's on for work, not screwing around, so this doesn't bother me. (I have it installed on a Thinkpad laptop so I can keep the screen farther from my eyes, and my employer bought the thing; it wouldn't have been my first choice.) I've given it two stars only because it worked great, out of the box, with no driver software. (This is on a Thinkpad running WinXP.) I'm already dreading the battery usage (based on another review here). Thankfully, it's not my main keyboard 
I've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase. I've used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player. (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.) I believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio. What do you REALLY get for a "high end" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know. I purchased one (which was "top of the line") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too. Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified! What does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it: --- "THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance." --- A digital signal is a digital signal. This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable. So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials. Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily. If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable. (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends). Overall, I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube) (P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables. These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed. Throw these tips away; you'll never need them again. 
Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006: We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific). We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both. For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine. Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them. At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times. But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it. Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended. If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse. Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon. We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results. Here is my update, which I wrote November 3: This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon. 
The Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel was purchased in Sept. 2006. I have had this for two months at the time this review is being written. I bought this to replace the corded version of the same item. The cordless works as well as the corded one. The trackball doesn't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did, but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use. I find the shape of the Logitech Trackman to fit the hand very naturally. It is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse, which is why I use it. I replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use. This is for home use with multiple users, with different mouse location preferences. I took the corded one to use at work, where it still performs flawlessly 8+ hours a day. I also have a Logitech cordless keyboard. There are two places where both these items could be improved: - Each one of these items needs it own receiver. It would save some of my limited home desk space if these could be combined into one unit. - I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor. I found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably. This is a documented requirement in the owners manual, but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless. The receivers, as stated earlier, take up space I would rather not spare 
I am totally stunned that this could be sold as iPOD compatible. Nothing, absolutely nothing, works as you would intuitively think it would. Pause does not pause, forward arrow does not forward to the next track (just starts the same track over and over again), and heaven help you if you actually want to find a specific song or artist. There is no way to actually speed through a menu - you have to advance one artist at a time. This is fine if you love Aaron Neville but chances are you will be in a limb severing accident if you are trying to get to ZZ Top. I am taking this back tomorrow and demanding something that will allow me to control my iPod again from my iPod 
I've had many fax machines and this one, when it worked, certainly wasn't the worst of the bunch. Problem is, the auto document feed tray is cheesy. No matter how many times I smoothed, then fanned the paper, it would accept two to five sheets at a time. If I fed one at a time, this unit worked like a champ. Unfortunately, that can be said of most units. I've had good Brother machines in the past, and probably will buy another, better, Brother fax. This one got me so frustrated I threw it out the back door. It's still laying there, only there seems to be more pieces now 
This is my second one of these (I pinched off the cable on my first one with a storage console door and had to get another!) The display has two settings: very dim and off. THe one I had before was quite bright so they must have changed something. That said, it works perfectly. You shouldn't be looking at the display while driving anyway 
I bought these speakers some time back. I was a bit skeptical because the sub woofer looked a little wierd. but once I plugged it in they sounded really good.. the remote control is really handy....... If you are looking for nice speakers for dorms or not an apartment these are it....they are really awesome...... They go really loud...I owned JBL Creatures 2 before and I prefer these to my old ones.... These Altec Lansings are the best speakers I have ever owned and trust me I have gone through the lot of the 
I like the color and sony's technology of the earphone itself. But the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless. When I put the earphone in the ears, the hanger part is just hanging in the air, not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady. Because of that, the earphones easily pop out of your ear 
After I read some folk's horror stories, I was really reluctant to purchase this device. Well, it took me only 5 minutes to configure the DWL-G710, and another 10 minutes to find the best place for it in the house. It was really simple and it worked well with our Comcast/Netgear wireless cable modem. Excellent product 
when I bought my Intel iMac w/20" LCD suddenly everything else looked dull in comparison. This Apple 20" is very close in spec to my iMac 20" screen. Stores like Best Buy do not have good quality 20+" LCDs in yet. You want the 16x9 profile also, the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios. The newer stuff is very bright and clear. It is obvious when you go to a store and look at the LCD screens. The cheap $200 LCDs just don't look good in comparison to the new stuff. Intel iMac screen: 1680x1050 280 cd/m2 (brightness in candle power) 800:1 Contrast ratio Apple 20" LCD 1680x1050 250 cd/m2 400:1 Contrast 14ms response time (www.apple.com/displays/specs.html) Other comparables: Gateway 21" 1680x1050 $599 300 cd/m2 1000:1 contrast Dell 24" 2405FPW $800 1920 x 1200 500 cd/m2 1000:1 contrast You should be aiming for at least 300 cd/m2 on brightness and close to 1000:1 contrast. These Apple LCDs have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out. If you are using your LCD for a TV you may need the brightness, but for computer work the Mac 20" LCD is just about right. I paid a few $$$ more ($750 total price) for the Apple LCD, but I feel I made the correct purchase. I just didn't like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my iMac. I actually like this screen better than the one on my iMac and it seems just as bright even if the specs say that it is not. Amazon also boxes the shipment (besides the Apple box) so your screen should arrive undamaged 
i had these headphones for a few years then they got crushed in half in my bag. they hurt your ears after about ten minutes. they are durable though. i would recommend the kind that clip behind your ear 
For the cost, you can't go wrong with these speakers from Jensen. We love them, and in shopping around found them to be one of the best home theater values. The sound is great, and the speakers are perfect for just about any home theater need 
i recently purchased these speakers for my patio setup. the sound quality wont blow your mind, but it does not sound bad. its large and lound enough to hear for an outdoor speaker for the price. it has a switch in the back for outdoor/indoor. not really sure what that does. very easy installation with the brackets included. (no screws provided) overall great unit for thye pric 
This was a very highly rated item on CNET. At the price I paid for it at Amazon it was like they were GIVING it away 
I got one of these a few years ago. It's been to several countries, on camping trips, bicycle trips, subways, etc etc and held together very well. I pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off I go, not lugging around a huge laptop anymore. The typing is comfortable, this is just like a laptop keyboard, and while I too have worried about the little popup part where you connect the handspring, it's taken a beating so far. I'm buying another preemptively because I'll be so bummed when I do eventually manage to break the current one. The hinge in the middle is annoying - you have to put the thing on a book or other flat surface to hold it in your lap. I think that when the new one comes, I'll try to create some kind of deadbolt mechanism to hold the middle hinge when it's open and then it will be the single most perfect gadget ever 
Please! for the love of god! do not buy this product! it is absolutly horrible. i'll admit that since i bought my computer and go this card back in 2002, i hadn't had problems until the past few months. i play an online game - a MMORPG - and after every time the game is updated and i have to install the updates i am unable to log onto the game! it freezes up, and either makes my computer crash or destroys my internet connections, forcing me to restart. as you can imagine, this gets rather frustrating, and if you play MMORPGs, you can see how it is even more frustrating. i am currently running XP home edition. i beg you, DO NOT BUY THIS ETHERNET CARD JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE CHEAPEST ONE OUT THERE! you get what you pay for! now i'm off to buy a new one 
I've been a gamer for almost 20 years. This is the best mouse I've ever owned. It is fast, accurate, well formed and constructed. I would definitely recommend it. The DPI adjustment is a nice touch. I prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy, this mouse is just right 
I have the Canon Rebel. I had the same problem where files were corrupted. Also, when clearing the card, some pics stayed filed. I am not happy with this flashcard at all. 
It helps proteck your ipod veary well. I already broke one ipod some how but with this case it well never happen agai 
The long cord simply didn't work. I returned it to Maxell, using the address on the back of the package, and had the product returned to me because the facility has closed. I've spent almost $5 trying to return an $8 product. 
The Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digitial Ultra II (SDSDH-512-901) sent to me was not the item I ordered. I returned the item, unopened 
Best earphones I ever had. Better then Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones. 2 years warranty 
OK. I take my words back. I found a solution to the connection problem with windows xp. Download a patch ( WindowsXP-KB884020-x86-enu.exe, solving WPA issues) from microsoft, then everything goes as it should be. ------------------------------------- i bought this USB adapter along with DI-624 router for $99. The router works perfectly fine. The USB adapter gave me so much trouble. i used it to connect my desktop pc to wireless network. It works when the network is not encrpted. But it won't find an IP address under WPA security. It searches IP address endlessly. I have winxp sp2 which is supposed to support wireless flawlessly. I think either this so-called 108m bps or the driver causing the trouble. Having seen others having problem with other brands of USB adapter, i think maybe for desktop, a wireless pci card is better 
This drive is whisper quiet, easy to install and use, and in my experience, plenty fast. I recently encoded my CD collection in flac format and am using this drive to store files. I also used foobar2000/LAME to convert the flac files to MP3, all on this drive. During the process of converting the files, which is pretty IO-intensive, I found the drive to be completely reliable and the speed to be more than adequate 
This car kit works very well. The screen is a bit larger than other DVD players of similar type. The only down side is that the battery only charges for about 2 hours (shorter than many movies). So, if you are going to use this in the car, you need to be able to charge it 
I was looking for a basic cordless phone with out an answering machine and this one is great. It has good reception and I like the size of it. This phone is just what I was looking for. 
Since I first wrote this review I discovered that the fault was not with the scanner but with my computer. After formatting my computer I was able to install the scanner and software without any problems. I am still learning to use it but so far I have decided not to return it. It works well and I like it very much. I apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone's choice 
I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row. I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks. 
I had to buy a new one, and I chose another brand (Logitech) this time. There is no On/Off button, so the batteries run out if you don't take them out (I think the buttons are pressed during transportation). Now the battery contacts are not functioning properly. And I had the same problem described in a recent review: "I'll click three or four times and nothing happens. Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end. It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen." 
The 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about 0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970's series of the HP hand held calculators 
I tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. So, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven't used so far. Although I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a "USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far. The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing. The Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet. All in all - for webcams, I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I've generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech. 
I'm a jogger, and like to listen to All Things Considered while I run miles and miles. This radio is great because the light weight is unobtrusive. It has a convenient "lock" button to prevent accidentally changing the station with a bump. I previously had a similar size unit from Aiwa, this Sony has MUCH MUCH better reception 
First and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves. They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me. That being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way. This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone. So why four stars? Well, for a few reasons: --Only available in white. I have a black 2G 8GB Nano. I'd have liked to match it. --No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano. While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn't disconnect so easily from the Nano that I'd fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place. For this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn't the best place for the Nano then anyway. The armband would be more appropriate. --NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano! I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart). When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said "for 2G Nano", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back. I was very relieved when it did fit! Regardless, there should be a very clear "For 2G Nanos only!" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners. All in all, I am very happy with the lanyard. It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for 
This is the third Palm PDA I have owned. I bought the E2 directly from Palm after my previous palm died. It simply quit shortly after the warranty expired. Telephone support is poor and expensive. After research this is a common problem. My employer pays for PDA's for executives and since I approve of all of these products, I will hereafter not allow any purchase of any Palm product based on falty products, poor customer support and extremely poor customer support. 
They sell these at almost every dollar store, sure the sound quality might not be quite as good, but you're going to have signal loss whatever you hook it up to. These things sell for $1.50 CAN at dollar stores and are worth every penny of THAT pric 
I use these batteries when I need power immediately and I don't have a set of rechargeables ready to go. I also use them as backups - so I don't get caught without power and have to pay $1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores. Unfortunately, my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set 
Ok. This is the 2nd ipod mini transmitter I have purchased that has broken within a month. All of a sudden it just stops working, for no apparent reason. Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk 
Though I like the keyboard, I've found two serious problems with the mouse. First, it is very sensitive to movement. I've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control. Finally and more importantly, the mouse burns a set of AA batteries about every 8 days. I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life. I've bought other Logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case I wish I had bought another brand. 
There is nothing good to say about this speaker except the size. The sound quality sucks. It stops mid song on a regular basis. It is just a piece of crap. It is so crappy that I am throwing it away rather than give to someone 
Garmin's devices are pretty good. Somewhat tempermental, but mostly reliable. It's connecting their software and dealing with Garmin support that is a nightmare. And, you will need to call them because their software has all kinds of bugs and an archaic key system. Customer service hold time: 30-35 minues. Response time for email tech requests: a staggering 5-7 working days. Clearly Garmin does not care about its customers 
DOnt buy and I had tough time in adjusting the ear piece as it falls out every time you hang it over the ear. 
I purchased this product to use with my Camera. The charging lasts very good time. Would recommend this product to others. Good work Amazon 
We needed to know if this unit (Philips DVD 782C) was compatible with DVD+RW disks so I Googled it and found this Amazon listing. We were totally amazed to find the reviews we found ... and wish we had done this years ago INSTEAD OF SPENDING ALL THIS TIME STRUGGLING WITH THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A DVD PLAYER. We have spent countless hours MR. Clean'ing and SkipDr'ing disks just to get them to play (and sometimes even that didn't work). Just in case anyone else comes along, take the excellent advice given several times in this collection of reviews ... RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION WITHOUT QUESTION IF SOMEONE OFFERS YOU THIS DVD PLAYER. Now, we do NOT believe this is a fundamental problem with Philips. We have, and have had, many fine products sold by Philips. We are guessing this particular DVD player was the result of some very poor product planning that went very badly before, during and after the fact. Hopefully the person(s) responsible has (have), per usual corporate practice, been promoted farther up the ladder where they can no longer inflict this kind of pain on Customers. P.S. We tried to give this product "0" stars but Amazon requires at least "1" star. Probably a quid pro quo agreement of some sort we imagine 
I was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don't think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time. I started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps! If you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did 
YOUR BUYING 128 MB WORTH OF FRUSTRATION AND $10 WORTH OF GAS FROM BACK AND FORTH TO WAL-MART. I bought my Creative MuVo and had it for a month or so. LOVED IT. had everything i needed, great mp3 worked great. One day, plugged it in to put a song on it and all of the sudden it starts smoking. Big hole in it from all the smoke. So, i return it at walmart for a new one. TWO DAYS LATER i plug it in my usb to put a song on it - smokes again!!!!!!! i returned it and got my money back... got an ipod shuffle, buy that much better mp3 player wont start on fire... 
I'm using the Monster Cable MP Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high-end tube pre-amp. The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone. The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly. If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated. 
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG! Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't). Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
This is the same cartridge I can purchase elsewhere, but cheaper. It works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my HP printer prints fantastic photos when I use HP ink and HP premium photo paper 
I agree with the previous review. This phone cord worked twice. Now, it only retracts about half way, and keeps getting worse. I'm returning it for a refund. Don't waste your time with this 
I was extremely excited when I received this product and have had good success with Samsung products. However, when I made all the connections, the unit didn't work. I was disapointed and frustrated. All the connections and settings were correct, but it didn't work. I have an older DVI connection instead of the newer HDMI digital connection. I returned the product and bought the Humax brand HDTV tuner. I bought a DVI to HDMI cable and connected the unit. It works like a charm! I don't know what was wrong with the Samsung SIR-T451, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I'm also having second thoughts about Samsung products now. It seems like the reliability/quality factor of Samsung products has declined now that they are more mainstream 
work fine with my hp pavillion zd7050. increase the performance of my laptop 
Either I am idiot or this product is very poorly designed! It takes forever to get it just right, so that it won't slip off and still it feels uncomfortable and not quite right. Now they have them in sorts of colors, don't buy it, you'll just get annoyed everytime you want to use it, like me. 
it did not work at all and Amazon would not take it back saying it was my responsibility that it did not work. I would never buy this or any other product from this seller 
I've got a LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-1673S burner (Revision JS02) in my fast G4 Mac running OS X Tiger and burning with Toast Titanium 7. Although my burner is nominally 16X-capable, it only burns at about 6X in my setup, probably due to the slow (ATA 33) bus it's on. I've used a number of different brands of 8X and 16X disks, both +R and -R, and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2% -- so few, in fact, that I often don't bother verifying video DVD's anymore when burning TDK or Maxell discs. (I always verify data DVD's, since errors in those are not ignorable.) But with Memorex, I've gotten about 20% failures, including a couple of aborted burns! In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones! The Memorex discs I'm referring to have Manufacturer ID "CMC MAG, AM3". According to videohelp.com, these are sold under at least 7 different brand names. The reviews there are rather mixed, which is not IMHO good enough! I have not, BTW, have had any problems with the Memorex DVD+R discs I've tried. But I stopped using them because one of my players won't recognize the +R format 
These phones had so much static, you could not hear!!! We ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use! 
The extendable arm breaks very easily. I had two of them and they both broke within the first month. The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement. Very poor product. Do not buy 
This is the rockinest think i've ever seen or buyed dudes!!! check it ou 
This does what it's advertized too. I like not having wires. The iPod in my bag, and just the headset. It would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset, ie turn off the headset, receiver and ipod all from the headset. Instead, I have to get the ipod back out, turn it off, turn the receiver off, then turn the headset off. Otherwise, the sound is good and the headset hasn't broken for me yet 
The keyboard is good quality and the best product I could find for the price. I recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard w/numeric entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space. The keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer. So makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers. 
I have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination. Suddenly I could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself. I called engineering in the hotel I was staying in to help me. It took them less than a minute to cut the cable with ordinary pliers. 
I just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup. I had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck. However, with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear. It is so small and just excellent. Great work, Logitech 
Pro: Very clear, stylish, eazy assemble. Con: None I can think of 
If you got a crappy brand TV like the Samsung the East Meadow guy got, you might need a super-expensive cable like this to make the image quality acceptable, but if you have a namebrand TV like Sony or Sharp or Philips or Toshiba or Panasonic, a $15 HDMI-DVI cable totally suffices. This Monster cable is no better than the $15 guy (also available on Amazon, just search for "hdmi dvi cable"). Don't waste your money 
This was the least expensive 1 GB memory card I have ever seen and it works as well as it should 
My friend bought one and I tried to set it up for him. Let me tell you, this thing is pure garbage. I spent a good hour and a half trying to get it to work. I tried to set it up using 2 laptops which were set up exactly how the booklet outlined. The direct ethernet connection wouldn't work and connecting to it through wireless was spotty at best. I could sometimes get into the setup page through wireless, but all of a sudden the setup page would stop working. Stay away from D-Link! All their products are cheaply made and difficult to configure 
I'm not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones, but I have used the same pair since the summer of 2000 (purchased from Amazon), and I have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers, which were easily replaced. When they are wound up in their little yellow case, the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don't offer such security. Compared to other headphones I have used, especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties, these phones have superior bass response, and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear. I have used these earphones with many different devices over five years: CD players, MP3 players (including iPods), Pocket PCs, desktops, and notebooks. They always sound great, EXCEPT - due to their greater sensitivity to sound, I often am able to detect the hiss caused by poorly designed audio hardware, which I otherwise wouldn't hear with over-ear phones. Pocket PCs especially seem prone to this, as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors 
I have had mine for a week. I had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years, which was misplaced. I bought the navigation kit at the same time I ordered a 60 CS. It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps, upload or download from/to my gps. I am impressed by the softwares ability to "recalculate" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route, it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am. I am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained. I have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example (to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane), and knowledge of one-way streets etc. The real test is yet to come to negotiate San Francisco's endless no left turns, one way streets, construction and limited freeway on ramps!! 
This flash drive does not work with Windows 98SE. The back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for Windows 98SE at the maufacturer's web site. First I tried downloading the driver. Turns out the driver is a .zip file so I had to download WinZip so I could unzip the driver. After downloading the driver and WinZip the flash drive is still not recognized by my PC. The FAQ at the manufacturer's web site states if the device is not recognized the BIOS on my PC must be enabled. But the FAQ doesn't tell you how to enable the BIOS 
My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it. I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well). Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves. My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me. Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite. My first impression had me rather worried. I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out. I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others. In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them. I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time. The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great. The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen. The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video. I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs. The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking. Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual. Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon. Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level. I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation. I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off. Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that. I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon. I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away. But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery. I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer. Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place. All in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner 
I've been 'trying' to use this phone for the past 8 months. Worked fine in the beginning, now I can't even answer my calls. I hit the TALK button, but the phone continues to ring. Spend a little more money but buy a better phone. This phone is a total waste of money 
Amazon has a nice price on the JBL Duet Speakers (July 2006 - 36.95) dealmac is a site I used and returned to amazon. I purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the "hints" of bass in the music but no thud, if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good. These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. Build quality is "ok". I got the white speakers and they are the nice "Mac" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on. The design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk. You will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in. They sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better. On the low end of speakers out right now, these will probably sound the best and are most modern design, compared to the black boxes out there 
Several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable 
Very strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you. Product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways. Otherwise, this is a well-designed and quality product 
I purchased this item and was excited to get them, but burning my first DVDs.. they're all coasters! ARG.. pass Memorex and go for a more expensive media, like Verbatim 
I had the same problems as already stated. I am currently having the volume issue as well, and yes my batteries are weak (the light is on). The first unit I bought lasted two weaks and then there was no sound at all. I called Sharper Image and they agreed to send a replacement. I waited two weeks and nothing. I called again and they had no record of my previous phone call. They did send a replacement and told me it would be sent overnight if "deemed appropriate by management." It was not shipped overnight. Bottom line - this product is awful. Do not buy - I regret it! It is worth it to spend more money on a different product. This only has a 90 day warranty and it doesn't last quite that long. 
I love it but its been a battle trying to get used to the sensetivity and pressure of holding the pen. I'm glad I bought it but it is something I cannot use all the time 
Works great, just like ti should, can add more sheets to store more. 
i was very disappointed with the ge superadio 3 i owned a superadio2 10 years ago which was far superior my advice save your money i had trouble with stations less than 90 miles away this radio is very overated.piossibly poor quality control 
I really like this mouse. It is easy to use and is one of the most comfortable on my hand. I have gone through a lot of mice and have finally found the one for me 
I'm very pleased with this camera. I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention. The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality. Video calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement, but for basic conversations, it is fine. I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL. This camera takes great video photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you. If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool. The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well. I don't use the face tracking. The base deserves a mention too. I use this on my notebook and on my desktop. It's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces. Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering 
I wish I had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk. As another reviewer says, U3 ruins it. I have a Mac so that feature is useless, but even worse it cannot be disabled. Everytime I plug in the drive I get this cheesy CD image cluttering up my desktop and I have to eject it, along with the drive icon, before the unit can be removed. What clunky engineering. I'll be returning this and scratching Sandisk off my list of reliable companies. I also agree with the reviewer who complained about the packaging. It is impossible to open without tearing it apart, which is probably a strategy to reduce returns 
I ordered v8 as soon as it was advertised by Garmin but they shipped v7 instead. Six weeks later I got the v8 update dvd. My wife and kids had to make due with v7 while in Madrid. She was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence. However, she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways. In the end, she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit re-calculate her route. 
Product came in as describe. Super clear picture quality as it's supposed to be as Monster Cable brand 
I bought these here and have had the for a little bit now. they work great. I will buy more when needed. 
A good basic AM/FM radio. Not digital tuning, but it works fine. Reasonably good reception 
I've had my HP5510 for 4 weeks. So far everything works to my expectations except--when I press the scan button an error comes up on the LED: Unable to scan documents from Printer to PC. No Scan Options. You need to install or run HP software for feature. Press OK to continue." My system is 4 weeks old. I had a local reputable company put my system together. We uninstalled and installed HP software several times. Went to HP website-could not find a patch. Couldn't repair error. My last resort is to call HP which I haven't yet. 
Others have written about this phone not holding the charge, and I agree! I can't tell you how many times a call has gone dead in the middle of a conversation, with no warning, no low battery message. I've only had the phone since November. There is not a quick, convenient way to redail numbers--you have to choose from a list of options, 1-plus number, or the area code without the 1, or no 1 and no area code. No easy way to speed dial. Range is disappointing. I'm looking for a new phone. Back to Uniden or Panasonic 
The CD sound is like being at the concert. Hooking the radio up to a television makes the home theater experience even better. The fm radio receiption is even clear. Great quality product. Worth the money 
Got it home and it had poor focus. The center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus. the next morning the focus problem was gone. Go figure. The big problem for me was the time it took to change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point. The Toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit Mute 
Easy to install, gret price and now I have surround sound on my PC. woowho 
Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised! To date, I've been denied twice. The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode! I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted." Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint. The product itself is average. I've used better and worse. That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price 
BREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video. It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa. Is this expensive? The answer is probably yes. This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods. However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative. This dock basically serves three purposes: - The traditional synch charge function available since the early days. - It helps you get "Line" output out of an iPod. Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack. It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater. - The super Video out for color iPods. This function is something you cannot get without the dock. So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use. As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the "Apple iPod AV Cable" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives. In summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV. If you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box 
I'm really happy with this purchase. I was worried that it would not work with Rhapsody (which is the media player I use the most), but it proved to work well with it. In fact, it works with all the media player I've thrown at it, including Windows Media Player, MediaLife, RealPlayer, iTunes, Rhapsody, DivX Player, WinDVD, and PowerDVD. All the buttons are functional (and I worship functionality - hence the 5 stars), although Firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work. No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click "Apply" and you're good to go a-browsin'!! Battery life so far is really good - it's been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago, and still going strong. The RF range is really good, although admittedly my room isn't big enough to really put its range to the test. Dorm-dweller users should be happy with the range, though. You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie. This mouse is also great looking; not cheap-plasticky but actually sharp and slick. It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control, but as a mouse it's really sturdy and ergonomic. I can't comment on installation since it's been a while since I first used it, but I guess no impression is good impression - if it was troublesome I'm sure I'd remember. I'd second the other reviewer's gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse, and this fantastic mouse doesn't come with a cordless keyboard... But it's a great buy, all in all 
I am amazed by the quality of the guitar. The product is extremely good. The service by amazon was ultimate. Thanks a lot Amazon 
I have been charged however I did not get a copy of the policy to date. 
One of the two ends was broken 
Excellent sound system, reminds you of being in a movie theatre. Great, Great system 
I have tried these dvdrs with the burner i bought from amazon and they do not work, i will try them again and send an email to you. I bought a few imation to try in the burner to ensure it wasnt faulty and they worked!!! what is up with these dvds? 
On the back of the package it says - 1) Transparent sound and powerful bass. - The "Transparent sound" part is true and "powerful bass" part is totally untrue. 2) Metal stabilized system for high levels. - What was that again? Metal stabilized system?? It has antiroll crossbars I guess!! When companies start making vague claims about their product - thats when you know that there is a problem. These sounded terrible at first - no bass - period. The sound changed for the better once I put on the foam covers. I could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization, it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency, decent midrange but little by way of bass - even though it claims to have frequency response going from 18Hz to 20kHz. It fits my ears properly, so that is not a problem. This product sounds far inferior to a pair of "Aiwa" ear-buds that came with a "Made in Japan" walkman purchased in 1990! I wouldn't even compare the sound of these MX400 to the excellent Koss over the ear headphones I purchased recently. Maybe they are better than the IPOD headphones (which suck even worse), and the reason people give this 5 stars. Really - no more than a 2 star product. Expected much better from Sennheiser. With this experience, I've decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from Panasonic. Reputable companies should think twice before selling junk in the marketplace 
Fantastic, take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality 
I bought this a few weeks ago so that I could connect a cordless phone to my office computer and use Skype for my calling. When it works, it works well, and the sound quality is fine. Unfortunately, much of the time, it doesn't work. It drops calls at random. Customer support is dismal, I emailed them several days ago and didn't even get a response acknowledging the email, let alone a solution to my problem. Just now I have tried reinstalling the drivers but that seems to be failing. We have a VoSky Call Center at home that so far has been working much better. I bought the the DPH-50U because I was in a hurry and the store I was at only carried it, not the VoSky. I wish I had waited and bought a second VoSky 
I use this in my videography business, primarily for weddings. So far I've never had a problem, and the mic has always given me a clear recording of voices from a lapel position. I use it in conjunction with my iRiver-795, to record the sound directly, and it's worked like a dream... recommende 
The matte photo paper that I received was really poor quality. No matter what setting my printer was set to, the ink ran together and created a really low quality photo. I do not recomend this item. 
Outstanding product as you would expect from Panasonic. Incoming calls loud and clear. The scroll telephone directory is convenient and easy to use. I do not like the "beep" sound when the hand-set is placed back in the cradle (it cannot be turned off 
I love bringing my ipod to parties and broadcasting it through the stereo, what use is this thing then, NONE! Thanks for making us spend so much money Apple. This type of stuff should be built into the iPod for $400!! 
Amazon quickly shipped this item to me and I was ready to rock 'n' roll -- until I plugged it in. There was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear. The buzzing noise stopped when I hit mute, so the Plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem. Amazon was very gracious about their return policy and I was quickly sent a new phone free of charge. Well, the second phone does the same thing and I'm returning it to get a refund. Maybe just my phone line? Possibly. But I've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both 
I got this less robust remote because I only wanted to use it on one system. And I was able to set it up and program all the different buttons, and it all fits nicely in my hand. They have great customer support available on the weekends. The best part is everything goes on and off with one button! THE DRAWBACKS: a couple of buttons you can't program or use for anything. And my goofey tv has 3 component modes and this thing is set up for 2, so getting it to sink up right is tricky, and it's constantly getting out of sink. 
Good price. Good company. I use this on my Kodak CX7300 and it's fine. Good product to buy 
Box worked perfectly as expected. However, it would be nice to be able to upgrade firmware to the new HD like performance or via a trade-in program to allow old customers to upgrade to the new Sling boxes 
Several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable 
The navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on. Our Toyota Highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top, but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well. The Ique was able to hold signels with no problem. I think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area 
I bought with lots of ilussion this this Ipod, i put all my music in it and use it!! after a 5 months it stop working, it didn't charge the battery. I took it to best buy where I bought it and they told me that it has "external damage" and didn' repair it. I send it to Apple service and return it without services because the same reason. My Ipod didn't have that damage, it has only a few scratches on the screen. After lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it I would have to pay US$250.00 that is almost what it cost new. TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM APPLE.. SHORT LIVE.. DON'T RECOMMENDED. Now I'm looking for another option for MP3 player to buy. If you know one please let me know it. 
On a recent trip, I was 23 hours in transit and couldn't have made it without this little device. It powered my movies and TV shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker. I was worried that the four AA batteries would make it heavy to carry but it didn't matter when the device was sitting on my tray table. Besides, it was comforting to know that AA batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world. By the way, I substituted the original batteries with Duracells on the advice of previous reviewers 
I recently bought these speakers because I wanted to play my iPod in the office. The sound is better then expected. While I would get a better speaker system for my home, for the office or on the go, these will do very nicely 
I live in Manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception. I use it hooked up to an HP 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner. It took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception. The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football 
DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE! This mouse has given me nothing but frustration. 1. The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low, causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time. 2. Battery life is horrible. Like 2 weeks... 3. When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes, it goes into an automatic sleep mode. The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to "revive" it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen. So I have to reboot my computer. Absolutely the worst!! 
PROS: small reliable very good quality with pictures ease of use good software easy install affordable CONS: ink tends to run out quickly with pictures slow rate of printing usb cable not included overall: 5 amazonian stars for the average user 
The cd player works well, just wish the random play would work for all of the cd's instead of only one 
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons. 1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub. 2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant 3. It is clunky 4. Does not comke with a power adapte 
From day one, back in late August 2006, I've had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn't work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it 
I have this drive and been sucessfully using it with Backup on my Mac. I would recomend it for off line storag 
Very bad start, bad point for Amazon. I wanted to get a good quality device and that is the reason I chose buying from Amazon even it was more expensive than other sites. I just turned on the device and tried to search for broadcasts. It was like all the radios in US were shut down or at least in my region. By mistake I filliped the device and surprise: the device started receiving radio signal. After that everything seemed to be OK but some strange noise in headphones. Cons: failure/malfunctioning while operating the radio. Pros: - great sound (with other than manufacturer provided headphones); - long operating time using rechargeable battery; - excellent expandable via SD cards feature; - I love the flip display capability. I really love that device because of its features and I hope it was only my mischance getting a damaged one. However I requested Amazon the replacement of the device instead of reimbursement. I also already advised some friends to buy that device. As a good point for Amazon, the very fast answer when I requested the replacement of the device. I will come back with updates after I receive the replacement. Hope a good one next time. Thank you Amazon Team. Coming back after receiving the replacement device. First of all it was a very good idea buying Amazon fulfilled products even it was a bit more expensive than other sellers. The replacement came faster than the product. Excellent Amazon Team and very professional. It's a pleasure doing business with you. The device works perfectly. Really a device you must have. More than that, my friends I recommended the mp3 player are very happy with their new acquisition. They were luckier than me. 5 Stars for the product now. 
I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing "Bourne Supremecy" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy. As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product 
Printers have gotten inexpensive. Let's face it; the game is, cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills. I'm fine with that. For the $149 Amazon price, this machine actually *does* do everything I need it to: a fax machine for those rare occasions I need to fax a physical piece of paper. A great inkject that doesn't consumer *that* much ink. It copies and scans. I have used every function, am pleased with them all. Sure, it feels a little flimsy; it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office. However, it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months, so that flimsiness isn't really even a complaint. And I work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month, so I am more than glad I can reproduce all the functionality my "real" office provides me. All in all, worth the money 
I love sound systems. So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product 
This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car. Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap 
Our new VCR/DVD player is wonderful. Set up was easy and I am even able to record-- something that the set-up configuration on my last model was unable to do. Delivery was even faster than expected! Quality is teriffic and price was reasonable 
For those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful. Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc. It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one. One of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section. I record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iRiver. For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it's a little trickier. You have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly. I've recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on. Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show. Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show. I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results. A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products. The single AA batter lasts a good long time. Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low. If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved! The negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive. Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer. I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file. But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another. Also, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way. I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes. I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button. After so many presses, it's starting to wear out. But it's still working reliably. I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention. I have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great. I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it. Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs. I'm quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future 
After going through the reviews, I bought this CF card for my Canon Digital Rebel. So far it has worked fine, though I don't pretend to be an expert digital photographer. When the card is empty, it shows 127 shots available. It seems to read reasonably fast, though it takes a bit longer than I was used to with my point-and-shoot Olympus and its SmartMedia card. 
This unit is a good buy. It is priced low, but functions like you paid a higher price. The negatives are that it isn't compatible with Itunes, and the earphones are not very ergonomically designed. Overall, it is a good product 
The transmitter doesn't work. I tried everything I could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt 
I ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it. I'm sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse. I got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got. (Apple doesn't offer a decent blue tooth 2 button mouse in anything like an acceptably reasonable price range) 
I purchased this receiver from Fry's Electronics in San Diego, CA for $199.99. At first, I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it's home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30's as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT!!! 
Dont microsoft ever send their software thru Quality Assurance checking? They asked me to install a windows update (KB something or the other) saying that it prevented the software from running at 100% CPU usage. Lo and behold, it still gets stuck!! Task Manager dutifully reports that it is after all consuming all resources 
These batteries are great, and seem to fit my Rio 500 better than some discount batteries. Good price too 
Overall, a good phone. Low cost. Well built. Many features. Speaker works OK for the price. Features such as caller ID and the speaker phone are powered by batteries. As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often. This phone would be a great phone (for the price) if it did not use batteries, but was a plug-in model 
What a wonderful surprize. It took about ten minutes to install them to my HP Media center computer. They replace speakers that came with my 19" monitor which were lousy to say the least. (speaker make with held) But the vs 4121s surpassed all my expectations. While I am not an audiophile, I do admire and expect good faithful sound reproduction and these speakers more than do the job. I don't understand how the more expensive ones can do any better. Suffice to say I am completely satsfied and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for their moneys worth 
JBL speaker system for IPOD is an outstanding product, I would highly recommend it 
This is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune. 
I hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod). The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me. The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups. The only "bad" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok. I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway. Edit: I bought it for $20, but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one. I'm not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don't buy this for your 5G iPod unless you're already sure or can try it before you buy it 
Do not get these headphones, as they are way too tight. I have been using them for a month now, hoping they would break in more, but they have not. You can only have them on for 20 minutes or so before your ears hurt so bad you have to take them. Im not sure why they made them so tight, but they would probably best fit a 10 year old. 
This is great! My only problem is the knob for adjusting. It's to loose 
ok mimo is becomming popular ....i dont give a darn. my home net work relies on a cable modem(moto4200)+wlanRouter my house is 2 story high and it's made of steelbar re-enforced concrete... with brick wall here and there... since the internet performenc is lower then 9mbits max... all i wanted was penatration through the concrete floor.. i 'v used pen type? usb adapters and so on ...but they were always short in range ...but g120 was another demention ... allover the house allrange !when i put this close to the wall adjacent to the negihbor's house, i was able to update my neighbor's router firmware (i've done it twice already) speed is not the main concern in my case . but you guys should know about it's response speed . its a little slower then pcmcia types even if i use usb2.0 connection but i think thats because my lap top is running xp-pro on celeron 800/256mbram. as long as you have a good pc (faster then mine~!) you wont have any problems. it's not that hot dont worry! i wont give this product 5stars because it's not small enough. who needs mimo. ! ps: use the zero config not the stupid utility 
The reviews sounded too good to be true. The reviews are right on. This system is perfect for home theater. I have the latest Panasonic plasma. This receiver is the perfect compliment. Here is why... I could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer. Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison. Tons of input/output connectors. Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect. The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection. Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs. Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical. I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box. Really easy set up. I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver. The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures. Did I mention the sound. Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price. With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels. Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all. Best of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful. It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station. The end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation. All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends. Get this receiver 
I got this phone about 1 month ago and I like all the features of the phone,Volume control ,Caller ID,Large display window and you can add up to 10 more hand set 
I purchased this camera for my daughter for Christmas. It was small,compact, and fairly inexpesive, perfect for a preteen. First, it took forever to charge (the instructions indicate that it takes four hours). After waiting for hours, my daughter attempted to take pictures, but the camera would not work. The manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the LCD display, but none of these symbols appeared on this camera. I am returning the camera immediately and I would not advise anyone to purchase one. 
This product is not for the heavy handed after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card, and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs'. on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types 
I previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse, I can't recall the brand, but it was awful (battery contacts wouldn't stay in contact and it was hard to use). I was using my laptop at my brother's house and he lent me his Logitech V200. It was AWESOME! Just plug in and use! I went home that nite and looked it up here and saw that others had had similar experiences, so I bought one. I've had it for about a month now and love it. The scroll wheel being able to lean left right for sideways scrolling is a nifty feature. I recommend this product highly 
... it's called a leash. Or a fence. How about keeping your pet safe the responsible-- not to mention cheap-- way. I've been a volunteer at a no-kill animal shelter for 5 years, and I'm still amazed at the lack of guardianship people show for their pets. So your dog has this $350-dollar doodad on its neck. It's not going to keep it from running out into the street and getting hit by a car, or picked up by somebody who wants to use it for dog-fighting bait or sell it to a lab (yes, these things happen-- often). Have some sense, people. This is ridiculous. 
We bought this unit from Sam's Club right before a trip to Disney World. (8 hours in the car with a toddler--eek!) However, it was/is perfect! We still use it for trips around town when we're in massive traffic or our son is being really fussy. The case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work, but we figured out a way to make it work for us. Also, the remote doesn't work well, but we don't really need to use it as a DVD usually lasts long enough between stops 
I bought this mouse originally as a replacement for a $9.99 mouse, and I'll never turn back. THIS MOUSE IS OUTSTANDING FOR GAMING. It's pretty damned accurate, and it easily fits in my hand. Good price, too 
It is an okay printer (I haven't done photos yet) and pretty fast but I have to change the cartridges every 3-4 weeks. This is just home use I'm talking about, not business use. The cartridges are small, run out real fast and cost up to $60 a month for one black and one color. I'm thinking of going back to a Lexmark 
Protects the Garmin's 60 screen from scratches, but interferes with the button operations a little. Worth the hassle to protect the screen 
I bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items I need to carry back and forth (umbrella, lunch, spare battery, paper, etc). It's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations. Its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally. I was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward, but it's not. My only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days 
I have to admit, I'm a GPS junkie. I've had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving. I am greatly impressed with this unit. It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites. This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on. The user interface is very easy to use. I've used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface. I think Garmin's is better. One highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating. This allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - "let your fingers do the walking..." If you don't tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest. I didn't know which city to specify and I did a search for "Eagle Rock Rec" (I was too lazy to spell out "Eagle Rock Recreation Center" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to. I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination. When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location. The advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340. I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations. The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels. If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache. The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune. The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names). Since I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin's MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen. It worked! So now I have the c340's excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures. One thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit's WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled). Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range. Also, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog. Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes. They are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid. I give this unit a highly positive rating. I like it 
I ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here. BIG MISTAKE. Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded "UNPLUG/PROTECT" screen came up. Now it won't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it's not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!! On top of that, even out of the box, NONE of the video inputs worked. Audio was fine, but video was dead as a doornail, right from the start. And even on top of the fact that this machine CAME broken... it sucks even when it works right! The DVDs take forever to load, and it comes with HDMI out, but NO HDMI IN! So if you're an HDMI user, I hope you have multiple HDMI inputs on your television... one for your cable box, one for this crappy system. This is a piece of junk. For the love of god, don't waste your money 
A device like this either works or it doesn't. This one happens to work 
The Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room. Though I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread. The sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don't get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more "sustain" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff. The bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don't worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality. Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS. You get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers. I would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you're willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound. I also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you're looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your "budget solution" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better. 
who would even think about buying something that plugs into the wall for sixty bucks! maybe thats why the ipod is so expensive............... 
A super picture with this cable! For the price, you've got to try this before spending hundreds of dollars on others. I give it 2 thumbs up 
I bought this and I'm sorry. It sounds horrible. Don't waste your money because you'll just have to buy another one anyway for any true enjoyment. This crap is barely good enough for my bathroom 
I just received my pair today, and I have to say, I'm extremely dissapointed. Yes, they are comfortable, but the bass is almost absent, no matter how far you jam them into your ears, the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be, it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid hi's they produce. Unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max, I'd recommend another pair of earphones. If you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass, these are your headphones. But, as others said, you can find much better earphones for a much lower price 
It's the most expensive CF card with absolutely no customer support. After a while the CF card stopped working - no power light as if the card burned out. I really can't tell you exactly what went wrong because it's impossible to contact someone at Socket customer support. I followed their web-site instructions but was never contacted. I'll never buy another Socket product again 
I will not be sending this item to my frail 85-year old mother in law to help her survive in hurricane alley on the west coast of Florida. It is virtually impossible to open the battery case cover to assemble the rechargeable battery connection for this radio. Most folks would buy this and store it until needed and so would not know in advance that they cannot access the battery compartment. This is unacceptable design failure for something the Red Cross is touting as a household essential. When the company was contacted for assistance, they suggested inserting a butter knife in the hinge and forcing the cover open!! Folks have already reported being injured in trying to force the cover open. I will be returning this one as soon as I can 
For the Epson Photo 1270, the photo quality and color are excellent. I have printed digital photos that people cannot believe come from an inkjet printer 
This product did not reliabley work in a new Sony PSP running the current Sony software. Don't know if the design is flawed or the unit I received was defective 
These speakers were purchased for office use and occasionally for on the road. They are a great look and compact. The sound is decent and should not be confused with higher end speakers. They serve the purpose for which they were intended as far as I am concerned as I purchased them to play my NANO I-pod. I do recommend them. 
I have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control. I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up down buttons with the + - buttons. The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver. The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do. As stated in others' reviews, you can't read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless. However, it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus. It is compatible with the latest video iPod. I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers. I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me. I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality. Then again, I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup. Since I have this little gadget for my wife, I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better. In summary, this dock does a good job and the design is not bad. The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote. If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet. The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock 
I had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it. It had gotten very good reviews. Ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some. Highly recommend it 
I have a 5gb but a lot of the H10's are having the same problem. I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution.... 
VHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect 
I had high hopes for this case when I bought it, but it just hasn't worked out. The leather has a nice feel, and my iPAQ fit snugly in it's slot. However the stylus on my iPAQ h2215 was impossible to get to without partially removing the iPAQ from it's case. This became so frustrating that I eventually discontinued using this case. It does have three slots for credit cards, and a larger slot that you could tuck a few folded dollar bills or business cards in. Maybe a different model of iPAQ would work better, but it hasn't been a good fit for me 
This has got to be the worst camera out there. I don't even think it's suitable for my 13 year old son. The pictures come out horrible! Good thing it was purchase mainly with gift certificates. I'm still sorry I wasted them on this piece of junk 
This would be a GREAT product is the chemical smell was not so bad and last so long. It has a horrible smell that just will not go away. I saw others mention the same issue but thought I would give it a try. It smells. Other than that, the comfort is great. But I gave it 2 weeks to air out and the smell will not go away. I would suggest you don't buy this is you have a sensitive nose. It kinda smells like those squishy foam beds and slippers you see at Brookstone 
This is a great little piece of hardware. I bought it for my MP3's and movies, and I'm very pleased. It's totally "plug-n-play"; there aren't even any drivers that need updating, assuming you have XP up to par. It gives 160GB (well, 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once, on the first day, it froze up. After that minor incident, I've had no problems, though, and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it, I'm very happy with it. It has given me no fuss--it doesn't even give me any noise! It's as silent as a fart, and that's a big plus. I found mine at Wal-Mart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you're on a budget, this is about as good as it gets. Seagate's 300GB is also highly recommended, as I've worked with it before. A+ 
Wow, who would've thought that you could get such amazing products, at affordable prices. The staff's friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have. This is one amazing phone system (Uniden TCX905), I forgot that it's a cordless. 
I was so happy with my Creative Zen Nano that I bought one as a gift. I love the color choice and the sound is great. Love the pause button. It came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band. You do not need to buy one!! Amazon delivered it in 2 days 
This simple device is reliable for fixing positions. And If you know about coordinates, you can set it in, and bingo. You can compensate what it lacks of by using coordinates from a map while you paid unexpensive 
ANTonline sent me the wrong item and then wanted nothing to do with me when I went to exchange it. They have no phone number, so they email everything. It takes them a day to get back to you and they always have an air about them as if you are bothering them for thier mistake. After days of persistance and me being as rude to them as they were to me, they agreed to take the product back, but I had to eat the first shipping charge, pay to ship it back to them and pay a 20% restocking fee (for thier error!!) The item was only like $10, so by the time I would have paid the shipping and restock fees, I would be in the whole, so I decided to just tell them to go F@#K themselves. I feel better now. 
This portable color tv doesn't give me any channel that you can actually watch. I returned it and I was credited. However, much to my surprise I received the same five inch tv as I had returned. It already cost me to have it returned. Since I didn't ask for it, should I consider it a gift 
Great value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product. 
I bought with lots of ilussion this this Ipod, i put all my music in it and use it!! after a 5 months it stop working, it didn't charge the battery. I took it to best buy where I bought it and they told me that it has "external damage" and didn' repair it. I send it to Apple service and return it without services because the same reason. My Ipod didn't have that damage, it has only a few scratches on the screen. After lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it I would have to pay US$250.00 that is almost what it cost new. TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM APPLE.. SHORT LIVE.. DON'T RECOMMENDED. Now I'm looking for another option for MP3 player to buy. If you know one please let me know it. 
Ordered it, took about 5 days to get to me, and it's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it 
when i got the moniter i said it was cool and alright but whe i plugged it in it did nat work and i was angry.i tried again but it did not work so i tried to send it back but it was to much of a hassle.i decided t see what was the problem and send it to a electronics store and the told me the the ic was bad.the only thing i could have done is to buy a new adapter.so i paid 800 trinidadian dollars to get it to work.i was furious 
Like another reviewer, I had the SRF-H3 model, and loved them - comfortable, secure, decent sound, and *almost* indestructable. I was hoping these would be "new and improved". Well, they are new... I really do not like them. The electronics/sound seem to be at least as good as the SRF-H3, which is fine, but the new design does not work for me at all, for 3 reasons. 1. The bigger band that goes over the top of the head is almost square - flat on top, instead of curved, so the weight all rests right on the crown of my head. 2. The smaller band, instead of keeping it secure, just loosens up rather than hanging on. 3. The earpads, which were on wobbly stalks on the SRF-H3, to match the angle of the ears, are fixed on this model. so they push more on the rear edges of my ears, and push the headphones forward. The quality of the electronics and sound don't do much good if the things are a pain to wear. Maybe they will work well for some head shapes, but not for mine. Bummer... Maybe I can find the old model somewhere. 
This review concerns the "v3" hardware and firmware v3.0_20 - I did not purchase from Amazon. For the most part, everything works pretty well. I have discovered a bug where the log is not cleared after a scheduled-email out, which leads to strange behavior for the log-emailing function. I can always go into the web-interface to view or clear it with no problem. Another thing to note regarding the log is that VPN (not pass-thru) has its own separate log area, which does not get emailed out. As expected, Netgear support is mediocre. Level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and Level 2 support is VERY slow. I recommend you use the incident-submission area of the "My Netgear" website, so you can more easily track/respond to support incidents. For those of you using the FR114p model, this is basically the same thing with 8-connection VPN service minus the printer port. I figure, after a few more firmware revisions, this will be a really good unit 
My first mouse broke after only a few uses. When I sent it back for repairs, they sent back a refurbished mouse that did not work at all. Avoid buying this mouse at all costs 
Researched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32" LCD. Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues. I mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360. You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same. The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well. I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn't be happier. To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT. I've also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable. HD channels have a very good picture over the air. Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable. There's also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna. The only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can't use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna. 
Have this optical cable for about a year before it was broken. According to the package, it has lifetime warranty. Sent back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, "COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER". The company address on the label is: Recoton Accessories, Inc. 2950 Lake Emma Road Lake Mary, FL 32746. Made in Chin 
I purchased my Fuji CompactFlash xD Card Adapter elsewhere and it doesn't work in my HP officejet 7130 all-in-one. It won't load in as it's supposed to but will fit correctly backwards. Except then I get an amber light that says there is a card error. This is supposed to work with my all-in-one but it doesn't. For that reason, I'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed. I'm going to take this CP version back and hope the more updated CPF version works. I'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles, but I'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly. This one is definitely a thumbs down. However, this is my first dud Fuji product I've bought and I love Fuji digital cameras 
Handy traveler accessory. Retractable USB cord very nice. Had a small problem with Moto adapter, one of the locking pins would not release. Was able to get release wire reseated under release button and all working fine now 
It's great if you have High Speed enabled devices. It's very fast a 2GB is sufficient for almost purpose 
I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier 
Delivered on time, no problems setting it up (just followed the instructions to format it because I didn't want the default format it comes with, which is less safe). It's been running fine ever since I bought it. I can't comment on the speed of access because, since I leave it backing up over night, I don't really care. It's all done in the morning anyway, so I don't really need anything faster 
I've had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else. I have (or had) severe carpal tunnel syndrom. This keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely. I can't think of a downside. Yes, it takes a bit of getting used to and yes, the keys are a bit noisy. But I have no problem with that. It just reminds me I'm working. The number pad is excellent too. I'm getting ready to get another one to use with my laptop. You can't destroy this keyboard. If you value your wrists and hands, get this 
I was in the market to upgrade my printer and used Amazon's reviews to decide on a Canon MP530. It does a good job, but when I plug the USB cord into the printer, the connection to the Internet drops every time. I have to disconnect from the printer so I can get on-line. Recently I filled out a rather lengthy application on the Internet and plugged in the USB cable so I could print. That step caused the connection to drop and I got to reenter all the information. I will be returning the Canon MP530 and start my search for another all-in one printer 
Pros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small Cons: Stopped working, froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. But overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it 
This backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my MacBook safe. Its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything I need. As a chronically disorganized person, the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings. The strap is nicely padded and it's elastic, so shocks are well absorbed. A nice touch is a zippered 'cavity' at the top, which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger. The build quality seems excellent so far - it looks to be a very durable product. I've always had good luck with Wenger products in the past. The best part about this backpack is that it doesn't scream 'There's a computer in here!'. 
So far I used one tape of this pack. The video quality is pretty good 
My husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic - it really comes up with a great plan. However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand - but had to for dependability. I still don't like my Garmin as much - but at least it works. Come on Tomtom - get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions 
It's a Canon product made for another Canon product -- how can you go wrong? 
The first week I had these, the left earpiece's plastic "rails" which hold the earpiece in its slot broke. The parts that seem to need the most strength structurally are fasioned with cheap plastic. Sound quality is great, with music playing and noise cancelling active, a normal conversation is barely audible in the background; great for crowded offices. Battery life is good, I've gotten 24+ hours using a NiMH rechargeable 
My sound improvement wasn't as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might 
Wow, I can't believe how much I hate this bag. And it was expensive, compared to some of the stuff I passed up. I thought I couldn't go wrong with Targus...but I could and I did. First, the strap is horrible. It keeps getting twisted and I have marks on my shoulder from where it cuts in to it. 2nd, it's REALLY heavy. Lastly, there's all these compartments that don't do anything and mostly get in the way. Like the phone add-on. My phone doesn't fit in there, and even if it did, would I carry my phone on my bag? 
I decided to purchase this item because I needed to get SD memory for my g/friends digital camera, so I chose this one because of the price and the brand. SanDisk is known for their memory. Well, no need to say more, this thing works great. I will buy another one but with more space anyday. Thanks alot San Disk 
These are amazing products for low freq. they'll really get down word of advise don't use them for higher bass freq sounds more like a grinding noise after about 75 htz. Enjo 
I had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the FVS338. The main reason is the speed. I have a lab and we tested the max Internet throughput of the FVS318's at 1.2Mbps! This is unacceptable. Oh yes, this is with the latest firmware. Several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem. I contacted their legal deptartment the same day. Several promises were made on Netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist I reinstall my OS! I have successfully sued to get my money back. With all of my venting done, I would like to say that I am still a fan of the Prosafe line and will continue to use it. But Netgear be warned, I will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported 
While I read the reviews on this machine, it is clear to me that Lexar has some serious quality-control problems. For some people it worked, for others it was a miserable failure. I am in the latter group. Sigh. Mine was dead on arrival. I tried the device with *BOTH* of my Windows-XP machines and in both cases, it was unrecognized. Lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help 
I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise. The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use. The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable. I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly. I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play. It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP. In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player). Finally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products! As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one. It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months. Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though). Be smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod 
GOT THIS UNIT ON MARCH 28TH 2005 AT CIRCUIT CITY HAD IT FOR EXACTLY 2 WEEKS AND THE DISK STOPPED SPINNING! TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE AND THEY DIDNT HAVE ANOTHER ONE SO THEY TOLD ME I COULD PICK IT UP AT ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR STORE LOCATIONS AND IT WOULD BE "READY FOR ME" TO PICK UP! PICKED IT UP TOOK IT HOME AND COUPLE OF DAYS LATER WENT TO USE IT AND IT DIDNT SPIN!!! RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!! TOOK IT BACK TO CIRCUIT CITY AND THEY SAID THEY COULD ONLY FIND THE RECEIPT ON FILE FOR THE FIRST ONE(THAT GOT RETURNED) AND NOT FOR THIS ONE--- AFTER MUCH DEBATE NOTHING GOT DONE FOR ME AT CIRCUIT CITY BECAUSE THE RECEIPT THEY GAVE ME BACK WAS THE OLD ONE AND NOW I'M STUCK WITH THIS PEICE OF JUNK I PAID $369.00 FOR AND CIRCUIT CITY SUCKS TOO! CALLED AUDIOVOX TODAY 7/19/05 (WAITED A WHILE I WAS BUSY GIVING BIRTH AT THE END OF MAY)AND THEY TOLD ME THE 90 DAYS WERE UP (BY 10 DAYS!) AND COULD ONLY FIX IT FOR A FLAT RATE OF $93.00 PLUS SHIP!!! I AM PISSED OF 
These are the best portable headphones in this price range. Good bass and smooth, natural sound. In fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price. If you can afford more, consider the Sennheiser PX100 for about 40-50 dollars. But if you're on a budget or don't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones, these are definitely the ones to get 
It doesn't matter what DVD+ writer I used, Velocity worked! Not one disk became a coaster. I loved the Velocity DVD-R until I order 2 more spindles. I ordered it directly for the manufacture. When I received it, the outside plastic covering was cracked, half the Disks had the jitters and the other half was coasters. It seems to me that they trick you into ordering one with a great offer including free shipping. If you order any more, the person shipping it to you send you the rejects from quality assurance. I will never again order this product again period! 
I recently purchased a PNY 512 MB Secure Digital Card from Best Buy when it was on sale for $29.99 each card. I had been given a SanDisk 256 mb card for christmas the past year, which had gone curropt. The PNY is so much better and so much cheaper for virtually the same quality or better than my old SanDisk. I would recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with SanDisk or any other high priced memory manufacturer. Steve 
This does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is light, easy to pack, easy to use, and probably difficult to crack. (Though would-be PC pilferers haven't tried taking a hacksaw to my cable lock so I cannot comment as to its ability to withstand saws, blow-torches, or any other criminal's tool.) Other reviewers baffled me as mine is as described by Amazon. There is neither an alarm nor batteries. Why bother with an alarm if the PC is locked with steel cable? Seems like overkill 
...while this device does power your USB cable it seems to fail charging my Blackberry or my iPod. Maybe the 400 mA is not enough for that. I would not suggest to buy this item for these devices. For the iPod you better get the USB charger from the Apple store for 25$ that even comes with a standard iPod cable 
I would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months. There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days. The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time. The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box 
So when I first got the iHome for Christmas, I loved it. Well, I loved it in spite of the glaring bright light, that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep. However, after awhile the iHome will not register my iPods existence at all. Today I was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again. I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations. So, the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled. Useless 
This item said that it is compatible with all ipods but it is not. It is only compatible with the "old" ipods. Evidently there is a difference in some of the more recent ipods and this itrip doesn't work with them. We had to return the product 
I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift. Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews. It's great. The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply. The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own. Many people comment on the bass issue. For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion. True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website). I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience. The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit. Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not. There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also). By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew. Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto. 
We have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer. It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office. For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel. It's not a small, USB stick that goes in the back. It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan. I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel. All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me 
The plug on the external antenna does bot fit the jack on the Magellan unit - avoid this until Magellan figures this out. Seems like they would use a standard plug/jack pair for all products 
I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it. 
Is very neet item especiatlly since it is usable with 1:1 speed as well as 2 
I just recently bought a Sony DVP-S560D model DVD player to replace my older, more out of date player. I hooked it up, and to my surprise, it wasn't any better than my old player as far as quality. Then I purchased S-Video cables from Monster Video and now the colors are more vibrant, the picture is in higher-res, and I can see every little detail on the screen. The picture quality that these S-Video cables produce are surpassed only by component video cables, which cost many times more the price. If you are considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of only one DVD, you can get better performance and picture quality 
Everyone has already covered the basics, so here's the highlights: The audio listening quality is poor, especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response). This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal, since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad. The headphones are heavy, which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position. They slide very easily off the head, and apply a lot of downward force on the ears. I have a big head, and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure, now they don't slide off, but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use. At first, the volume slider is stiff, but then becomes smooth. After 4 months of use, the mute switch is getting loose, I don't expect it to work 4 months from now. I really like the microphone portion of the headset, the angle is adjustable, and the volume is loud and clear. In the end, these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones. Next time, I'd grab the cheaper Logitech headset, where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears, not some large outer pad 
Well, actually I bought this nice cable, at Amazon Marketplace great offering that it was, for an HDTV Tuner, which bombed in my neighborhood. So, I never did get to unpack the cable. But it's in the closet, and it knows it's a good cable. Great cable, @ great price, thru Amazon 
I purchased a unit recently and after a couple hours tinkering with it, I couldn't get it to work. I called Actiontec/Vosky support and spent almost an hour on the phone with them. They advised me to uninstall their software and Skype and to try reinstalling each product. When that didn't work, they told me the product was defective. Unfortunately, they refused to take it back themselves and made me deal with the Seller (ANTOnline.com) first (not a very good seller, btw, as they gave me a terrible time when I tried to return the defective product). Hopefully you'll have better luck. Also, be sure to check out whether Vosky is officially supporting Skype 2.5. When I made my purchase, they did not 
Installation on a normal home network setup is very easy. My setup was a little more complex due to voip router, and 2nd wireless router. Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. Video quality is good in the house, haven't tried it from another location. I'm running the Sling AV with Netgear Ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching TV via wireless to my laptop. Now we can watch TV in any room of the house. My wife loves being able to watch the news in the morning while in the kitchen. She also loves being able to surf while having a show running in a small window on the side. Control of my Dish DVR is very good. We can manage any feature of our Satelite/DVR box. This will come in handy when we travel as we have our sons Seaseme Street shows on the DVR and now we can take those with us on the road. Overall, I'm pleased with the Sling AV. It offers good performance at a great price point. Now Sling just needs to get the Mac version out so I can watch TV on my beautiful 15.4 inch Mac Book Pro 
I bought a second Traveldrive because the first one purchased worked just fine. The second drive does not work on my system (Windows Millenium). Calling the service line I found out that there are two versions and the second is not compatible with the first. After trying all the recommended solutions, the tech support suggested I request a warranty replacement/trade for the original version or simply get my money back. Requests for a resolution of the matter have fallen on deaf ears. I would not waste any more money on products from this company 
Great quality, excellent construction and strong RJ45 plugs. I have worked with a decent share of Cat5 and I have never had to cut and terminate a Belkin cable due to regular wear and tear 
Total garbage. No only this thing is huge, bigger than most mp3 players and it doesn't have a belt clip or anything, it sounds awful, absolutely horrible. The hiss others complained about is very loud, it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping, buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises. Besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible, low dynamics and distorts easily. This is a bad product that should be taken off the market. It's not even worth the price here. Heck, even $1.99 would be a waste of money. Avoid 
Terrible product. I have tried using the Windows XP wireless application with just the netgear drivers and tried using the Netgear wireless application with the netgear drivers. Using either one the card disconnects at random using WPA, then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back. I reinstalled windows both times I changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it, but nothing helped. Latest drivers are 2_0_0_7 and were published in Nov 2004, so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer 
I got this from JnR . This unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it. I tried this on multiple computers. MAy be this was just a lemon. I will exchange it to a better brand 
All in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something. Sound travels along wires... it's physics, there's nothing you can do about that. Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires. These headphones are called "asymmetric," meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left. You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck. This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands. This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire. I paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones. Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me. The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage. The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design. People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more. I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair 
This radio is poorly built. When you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out. You put them back in, carefully set it down, then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again...Now, I put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place....stay away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands...good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review... Bruce Payn 
I have been using this D-Link hub for about six months. The power light started flickering after about three months and now doesn't light at all. The hub works great, but I wonder how long it will last 
This router had 1/4th the range of my standard linksys G-router which suddenly burned out after less then a year. The speed (when I could get a signal) was 1 to 11 Mbps, my old router held a steady 54Mbps. I did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house, but I couldn't use it with this router. The expander only works with the basic G-router, so no way to even boost the signal on this new one. Support was a joke, couldn't get any help or explaination as to why the "Expanded Range" was so much less range the the previous "unexpanded range" Bought another older version, and everything's great again. Don't waste your money or time on this 
This product took less than 5 minutes to unbox, install, and work properly. Well built, and functions exactly as I would have hoped. I am impressed with the ability of the suction cup to stay attached, even in the summer heat of Las Vegas 
We purchased this phone to go with the rest of the set and we were extremely disappointed!! We had to return them for a different brand because we could not hear!!! They were so static that you often could not hear the person speaking!! You would think at this price it would not be so static. We went for a brand at a much lower price and they are crystal clear! 
Good sound for the price, and very durable. Discrete design. I prefer the "plug" design to other headphones. They don't fall out, and I can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane, it makes almost no difference. Just be careful in the traffic ;-) The sound is good, especially for music where the bass is most important, but the treble is also good for pop and rock. The middle range is a bit dry for e.g. classical music, but still good enough for an mp3-player. I have two pairs. 
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way 
I purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse. I wanted something with two separate buttons. I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful. So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse. I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well. In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons. Other than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment. First of all, the white doesn't quite match. It's close, but just a touch too cream. Also, there's just too much silver. Especially on the mouse. Secondly, it doesn't have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does. There is no button to switch to the Widgets. Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard. Not quite as convenient, but still possible. However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs. This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open. Thirdly, this mouse just doesn't work as well as other Logitechs. It is too light, lacking the "feel" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around. Also, the speed of the cursor is off. No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn't quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse. It is either too fast or too slow. I think part of it is simply OSX's lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed. Finally, the keyboard is simply atrocious. I don't even use it anymore. It's packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in. The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing. The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal. Also, the depth is quite shallow. This is a desktop keyboard. You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I've tried. Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform. The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow. I can't find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch. I have to look. As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin. It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it. I'm typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech. So, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo. I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place. It hit my most basic requirement. Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating 
This is the best device I have bought for at least a couple decades. I am a degreed engineer, and I love gadgets. Just the best. I have had it about 3 months, and I love it. Attractive base, all the connections, removable speakers, picture quality is among the best LCD that I have viewed. I highly recommend it 
What do they say about fools and money? HDMI uses TMDS which is a digital transmission system with built-in error correction. TMDS has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a $10 HDMI cable will meet the specification. If you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted $80. That's all there is to it. You don't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable. The picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10. In fact the signal is identical. Let me repeat - HDMI ( DVI-D) devices talk digitally with error correction. This cable and ones like it are for suckers only. 
These are some great headphones, BUY THEM FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE! I chose to buy them here because of the lower price, big mistake, what I recieved wasen't the item picutered. I don't know if there an older version or some knock-offs, the sound is ok... but there very cheaply made and theres something wrong with the hinges they don't fold properly. I have an average size head and even fully extended to put them on you have to warp the headband to the point that it looks like its about to break. Returned them and spent the extra 20 bucks to buy them from the actual site 
I have used these labels for a long time, mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there. The paperstock is good, but if you have a good printer the paper won't do it justice. The labels always end up looking kinda cheap. I would love to see Memorex make a package with glossy paper/high end paper. Maybe Epson will beat them to it 
Although there are more expensive options, if you're just looking for something to keep your iPod from sliding all over in the car, the iSqueez is a great option. I use this with the Monster iCarPlay FM Transmitter/Charger, which uses the dock connector. I can't get my iPod mini to fit all the way down in where it should because of this, but it still fits in there well enough to stay in place. I find that it holds the iPod at a great angle for viewing the screen from where you're sitting (though I'd recommend putting the passenger in charge of finding music) 
I purchased 3 of these APs with the expectation to replace 3 Cisco "b" APs and drop in. The setup used Radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs. After config (the web UI constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re-login) the system would work. One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn't accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now. I would HIGHLY recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it's buggy and has poor support. Config is difficult (I had to learn how to use the command line config), the upgrades are not well documented (they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp - you don't but...), however the unit does have good range and works (No RADIUS of course) in a basic config. 
We bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming marching. This is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice. This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades. The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD. The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set. If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood 
I never even traveled with it. It just stopped working completely making me lose data. NEVER AGAIN I'll buy anything from this company. This drive is a piece of rubbish! 
This was a defective unit. Got new unit and it works as expected 
Pros * Fits like a glove (goes without saying) * Um... Peace of mind? Cons * This case makes pushing the buttons harder than it already is. * There is nothing to protect the screen. * If you're left-handed (or like to operate gadgets with your left hand) note that it is impossible to push the Menu button. It would take a double-jointed freak of nature to comfortably push it. * The case is a dust and hair magnet. Every time you pull it out of your pocket, it's encrusted with lint you didn't even know you had. Dust manages to sneak under every surface, and hair magically sticks to it. This case is a DNA-sample paradise for forensic experts. One of the features of a flash-based memory player is the fact that they won't break as easily when you drop them. Unless you're paranoid about getting scratches on your shiny new Sansa, don't buy this 
This cable is of the best quality, quick shipment and at a price that beats all the retail stores - you can't go wrong 
This is very comfortable and works very well. It's heavy enough that it doesn't move around or push the keyboard, as some of the other types of wrist rests that I've used have done. Yet it's cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support. 
The KOSS Pro-4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users. TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's). Also, they require a 1/4"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment. These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the "Watergate" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones. Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome. NEGATIVES: 1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones) 2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size' is greater than 7 1/2. 3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount). POSITIVES: 1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA's is almost impossible to beat. 2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced. 3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years. They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil. 4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well. The sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes. The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA's for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen. Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they're not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware. If you just want 'jogging/exercise music', then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA's are still the best choice around. 
I had a Monster iCarPlay for some time and had givben it to a friend. So when I was looking for a new one i thought I'd try the Kensington. Big mistake - my car couldn't pick the signal up without manually tuning - very painful. Go for the Monster products over this in a heartbeat 
I have owned the TomTom Navigator 5 for almost a year now. While the program is well thought out and provides a good function, it does not work well with my Tungsten T5. I have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues (listed below), but to no avail. Some of the issues I have had: Any time the software has to redirect or think, it locks up. If I stay on the original planned route, it sometimes works properly... In a 30 minute trip from Orange County to Long Beach, I had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up. Voices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device. In a 20 minute trip from San Francisco to Oakland the device locked up 5 times. I finally gave up and called a friend to guide me. Bear in mind, I have had no problems with my T5 in the 1.5 years of ownership...it is only with this software. Customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing. In summary, it's not worth spending the money to have to print out Mapquest directions to have when the device crashes...stick with Mapquest 
When I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one 
I can't understand how apple sell so much ipod video while they are so bad in front of an archos. Just look at the screen and you'll understand ! Archos is an hundred times better 
This player is very convenient for long trips. If you want to save the money, you can get it Free from this web site: awesomestufffree.com/portabledv 
I originally placed my order with my a digital camera and this four year service plan. Three days after, I had to cancel my digital camera order for personal reasons. However the $161.80 total I spent on this warrant did not refund automatically and nor have I received a confirmation that it will be refunded. After several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund. They finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process. That is two whole months. Horrible service I can't imagine how long it would take for them to either repair or replace my camera should it have faltered. I would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies to anyone 
These are some great headphones with a few minor flaws: Pros: 1. Great sound quality 2. Very comfortable 3. Light 4. Worry-free charging Cons: 1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy, could require pressing the tune-in button several times 2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast 3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing) My experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. Regardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. 
Needed better protection than my $10 surge protector for my HT setup now that I have a couple DVRs a plasma. Filtering would be a nice side benefit too. Very little $$ more than the power-strip design units I was looking at ( now I see it dropped even lower!). Pros: Build quality, fit finish, plenty of outlets diversity of outlets for me, nice form-factor compared to power-strip design, cool looking LEDs meter. Cons: Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed are too bright (esp the blue one!) if facing HT viewers. I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card. CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn't use the cable line filter. Bottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon 
I knew these were inexpensive CD cases, but I can't even open one without it breaking into two pieces.. 
When it works, it works very well. But one day it suddenly died on me. I had a Comcast technician come and test my modem and after using some complicated equipments to test it, he concluded that the modem is dead. After he gave me another modem, my network is up again. Very bad reliability. MOTOROLA SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR QUALITY CONTROL! 
I recently purchased this item from Sharper Image and was very disappointed. The video is faint, grainy (even in strong lighting), and out of focus once you are more than 2 feet away from the camera. Colors all but disappear. It's practically black-and-white video. The power supply weighs more than the device itself (one pound, including cord) and is HUGE. It also gets very warm after an hour or so. I've tested this product in every type of lighting situation and the results have been unsatisfactory in all cases. The only thing the device does well is detect motion.
