Rating should be "0" but that wasn't a choice. I ordered this item at beginning of July pending move to a place that didn't have a dishwasher. They backordered it until August 10. So I waited and didn't have sanitized dishes in the meantime for myself and my 12 pets. Then, on August 9, they sent me an email saying "we can't get this item, we're cancelling the order." I have gone 5 weeks without a dishwasher! Now I have to go find another online store to order from. Target may advertise the cheapest price but THEY DON'T DELIVER 
This product is extremely quiet. My cat loves it and its great because it encourages her to drink more 
I have enjoyed using my Mario Baltali enamaled cast pot very much, it cooks beautifully and holds a large amount 
It says this is a 2 burner grill pan but that is so wrong. It does not cover 2 burners it sits in the middle of each burner causing the handles to be right ove both burners. Very dissapointing, I love the le creuset normally and was really looking forward to having a grill pan made by them. Unfortuanatelly due to the shape it will not work for just one burner either. Hopefully they will come out with an updated one, until then my search for a good 2 burner grill pan continues 
This thermometer worked flawlessly for the first 3 months, then the probe broke. Don't ask me how it broke because I cannot see inside the metal do-hicky. A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one. It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer 
So far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine. This is the first I'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don't. The machine is very efficient. You just put the mixture in and it does all the work. You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others. You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency. I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn't thicken and I wasted all of it, so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine. The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it, not as bad as I thought it would be though. Overall, very happy 
I have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier. They have excellent balance and feel. A major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the Calphalon 15 piece set. The wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice (light pine with no finish), but I don't use it anyway 
I just received this as a wedding gift and it is beautiful! A great gift 
The lid does not fit and is not heavy enough to keep it firmly on the pot.It allows liquids to escape.I think this could be a problem 
This tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass' - it doesn't seem to break. I'm hard on things and usually need heavy-duty models just for every day survival. I've had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn't seem to break. Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea. But here's the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea-shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does. The ONLY down side is that the cap won't fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out. But I have never found that to be a problem. The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me. The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I've had speaks to it's wonder and durability. Like I said, this is made of magic glass. 
I was expecting some of the dinnerware to be broken in transit and was shocked when I opened it up. Everything was intact, nothing broken to include the 4 drinking glasses. This dinnerware is EXCELLENT! The pattern is simple and is extremely easy to clean. I think everyone should have this set in their kitchen. : 
Though these utensils are not recommended for direct use with the Cuisinart pots and pans (they will scrape the finish) they have a terrific feel to them. They are evenly balanced with a useful machanical advantage. I find them especially functional as serving utensils at the table. This tool set is very well made, each tool has an excellent finish and "look" to it, the long handles and super excellent size for dishing out your cooking creations makes them a positive addition to any kitchen. I really use my set and highly recommend this kitchen tool set! 
I have Le Creuset and Calphalon pots and pans but I find myself constantly reaching for this Farberware pot. The design is why I bought it. I would have been willing to pay $100 for one just like it from Calphalon or Le Creuset but this is the only one of its kind I could find anywhere online. It doesn't have the weight of my other pots but the sheer practicality of being able to strain your food without worries of burning yourself (the spouts are great) or using another dish far outweights any reservations on possible durability. Kudos to Farberware for coming up with such an ingenious and sensible design. It makes one wonder if the other brands out there ever listen to their customers 
Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower. I also couldn't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. Even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise. Not just me but my husband too so it's not a case of super human hearing on my part :-) Yes the timer option is very nice. This was actually why I purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking. But what good is the timer function if the microphone can't pick up the barking? So read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units. Unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else. 
The KitchenAid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect. They are very will made and excellent quality. The silicone material is amazing, it is so easy to clean, whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix, cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it. The curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my All Clad mixing bowls. With this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl. Highly recommended 
I love this carafe---no drips like others I have used! The best part was how fast I recieved it----AMAZON was so efficient----I ordered it and before I knew it---it was here!! 
The combination of the great price and incredible durability makes this stuff perfect for just about everyone. Both I and my parents have been using Corelle dinnerware for over 15 years, and are amazed at how well they hold up 
The lounger is unique and can be used for watching TV or playing with games. 
It's sort of cheap, but it works quite well. The water comes out clean, with no odd taste (which some filter systems can do) 
I love this product , the processor is small but enough for a home kitchen and it doesn't take up much space. It chops , shred , slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff, the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out. The other bad thing is the plastic , everytime I use the processor the smell of what I'm making last in the plastic bowl and won't go away until I make something else. And I did clean it very hard. Overall I do Recommend this product to All 
This worked great...for 5 minutes. I tried everything to make it work again over three days. I finally contacted customer service and they said there is nothing else to do - send it to them and they will replace it. I'm glad they were responsive, but now I have to pay to ship the darn thing to Michingan 
It doesn't break, chip, or even discolor, but the base has a compound kick (depression on the outside and protrusion on the inside. This makes a very messy exit from the dishwasher and precludes removal of debris on the inside. Why hasn't any one noticed? Where's the reviews? I own a dishwasher (gee-) and this is a very irritating function-having to drain the glass, dry again, and place in my cabinent-geez! Don't buy it unless you have maids and butlers. The again don't buy it because they'll get miffed too! 
I carefully read most of the reviews for this product before purchasing so I would know what to expect. They mostly said the same thing: either it broke or it worked perfectly. The consensus seemed to say use only hard cheeses, and don't overcrank the handle. We have only used it for parmesan cheese, and so far we've had no problems. It works great so far 
I wish I had. This one goes to the Goodwill. Grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean. Grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular, like a chicken breast. Hamburgers work best. Watch out for burns 
I found this product cumbersome, and the instructions for assembly, battery replacement, etc. were not very clear. The vacuum didn't hold a charge well, and it was hard to remove the batteries for replacement. I finally gave up altogether and bought a different product 
I have used a Brita filter water pitcher for many years, and I love it! The directions clearly state not to use hot water, and the filter snaps into place in order for the water to filter through properly. When my daughter visits, she says, I'd like a glass of Brita water! : 
These are plastic-y, one cracked after 2nd washing, they look like the little fish bowls from the county fair, so big you have to use 2 hands to prevent sloshing it all over yourself : 
This torch just does not work. I won't stay lit for more than a couple of seconds. When it does stay lit, the flame is horrible. Please, for the love of God, do not waste your money on this 
I bought this for Chinese / Japanese style hotpot. It turned out to be a fabulous hotpot (fast boiling time) and an excellent grill! Although there are no grill grids, my Korean BBQ and Cajun shrimps turned out wonderful!!! I have used this pot extensively (once or twice a week) for the past three months and it continues to perform superbly 
I have owned this skillet for 25 years and it's still going strong, even with constant use. Still looks great, too. It's a good size, easy to clean and useful for many purposes. The aluminum core spreads the heat well. This is a great value for the price 
He just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again! It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why. When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long. It does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker. Terriers are just too stubborn to care if they're getting sprayed, I guess. 
I am not a fan of the pause and pour feature. IT is a button and if the pot is not directly under button the coffe over flows. On two occasions the machine stopped dripping coffee in the pot, casing grounds to overflow the filter. I can only assume the pot was not perfectly placed. I searched for a red coffee maker at a resonable price but could find none without this type of pause and pour. I may have to remove button for 100% satisfaction. But I love the red accents in my kitchen 
It may work O.K. for melons, but the handle is extremely uncomfortable and ackward to grip when attempting to scoop ice cream. In addition, the shape of the scoop bowl makes it difficult to get a full scoop of ice cream 
Le Creuset's grills, woks, and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be "Seasoned" like tradiitonal cast iron. There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface "patina" builds up that is quite non-stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned-on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build. Le Creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick. The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating. I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations. If you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems. 
I bought this in October, 2004 because I wanted something small for my kitchen. You cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker. Now, it shuts off mid-way and I have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it. Hopefully the "powers that be" will read these comments and make improvements 
I was helped in choosing this pizza stone by the hundreds of online reviews and suggestions posted by people from all over. Well, they were all right. Excellent item. I bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life... DELICIOUS! As others have suggested, I never remove the stone from the oven, and lately I just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done. I am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it. I am extremely happy so far and I'd highly recommend this item. Buon Appetito 
This mixer has many speed settings, but they all pretty much go the same speed. The "low" setting is so fast that if you are mixing much liquid it spashes all over. I would not recommend this mixer, spend a few more dollars and get a better one!! 
We have had this knife for about 5 months now, and we use it daily; anything from peeling and dicing fruit, to slivering a potato. It has a nice solid feel to it, and it has a remarkably sharp blade, which has held an edge very well. The curved blade makes it a bit of a challenge to hone 
The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. At this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer 
The interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use. It got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil. A lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains, but the pan never got its new look back 
This maker is the better of the two pod coffee machines I had. It is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind. My problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke. It probably was mostly my fault but it is made of plastic unlike the metal one on the other pod maker I have. That is why the other one still works and the Juan Valdez is broken. IF you are careful not to overfill your homemade pods you'd probably never have a problem with it. Just be careful in closing it and don't force it 
I love Corelle and purchased this for my son and his new wife. The item was not able to be delivered and I received a quick no hassle refund. Amazon is very easy to deal with! 
I bought this product back in July 2005 and have been using it to make my morning protein shakes. It does a good job of it. I cannot comment on its ability to make icecream as I try to stay away from that stuff. The unit has a very solid construction. The stainless steel glass is great. I just drink my shake from it. So it saves me from having to wash another glass. I just have one small issue with it. You cannot remove the spindle to clean it. You have to use the stainless steel glass with warm, soapy water, put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it. Well, the problem is this - while I am drinking my shake, the spindle is dripping liquid on the part of the unit that flares out on the bottom. Okay, okay, it's no big deal, I suppose. All in all, I like this product, and I would recommend it. 
Delighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs. Works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non-organic detritus that collects. Does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly - gosh darn! So much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house. Also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down, when I want to change areas being cleaned. Again, gosh darn! Can't totally eliminate ALL the work, no matter how much I might like to. Don't know what was wrong with it initially that it needed to be reconditioned, but its fine now 
I can't begin to describe how worthwhile a piece of equipment this is. It makes the best little potato shreds for potato pancakes, then, you just switch blades and slice up a little onion for them in the same bowl, which you can then mix the batter in. The bowl component is my number 1 favorite feature of this little guy, but it just plain works really well 
Yes, the Le Creuset spatulas are wonderful. They look great and are very, very useful. Throw away your old rubber ones which melt and buy one of these. You will never regret it 
I completely agree with the other reviewers. This product is so bad. It warps under the heat, the not-so-non-stick surface peels, and food sticks like glue 
This is a very comfortable bowl to use. Made of sturdy plastic, it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls, which makes it convenient and easy to use. The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip (really good when pouring batter into a pan, for instance), and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions. The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it - no sliding. I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it. Oh, by the way - it's dishwasher safe, too. I've washed mine over and over and it still looks new 
I'm sure this is a fine pizza wheel. Unfortunately, I've not yet been able to use it, as the @#$!*$ sticker that came attached to the blade is vitually impossible to remove. Geez. 
First of All I was abt to buy this product... but cancled my purchase as I found the same kind toaster with less price in the market.. But same time I bought one kitchen utensils set.. and I am sorry to say it is just usable not good one like I they shown.. I saw many utensils set with same number of item atleast 500% times better than what I got, Second thing, I wanted to cancle the order immidiately but I tried to find out the customer care no on the amazon site.. but I could not find one :o(( any way thats why I have decided not to buy from this site anymore... as now I can't rely on the pics only.. 
I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware. Best set I have every owned or used. Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots pans. The fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top. I paid $26.57 for this after discounts and free shipping 
I love our new white Corelle. It is so light and takes up much less room in the cabinet. 
I just received my Jiffy Steamer J-4000 Pro-Line. It was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words "USE ENCLOSED FUNNEL" in caps every where. I sent an email and they said they will send me one (they seem to have a good customer service). Now that we have dispensed with the whining, lets talk about the product itself. If you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron, this is not for you. However if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you don't want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time, this does do an amazing job. I have also purchased a JIFFY personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs. However if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for J-4000. You get the wrinkles out faster. If you have a concern about startup time, you do have some control over that. I just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes. If you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time. Or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it. Standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at 90C degrees (close to boiling). If you can afford it, buy one. It would make a great re-gift item if you find out that you don't like it 
I used this seemingly incredible product and accidentally left it in the oven during a self-cleaning. It completely evaporated and left teflon covering the entire interior of the oven. I had to replace the oven! It was toxic from the teflon powder. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! 
This is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased (actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to. The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line. With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters! All Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting -- technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well. The razor sharp laser cut grating head will make quick easy work of cheese grating or citrus zesting (if you have the proper size). I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size. Now, what makes the professional so much better? Well, the standard line has 3 major/minor flaws: 1) the easy-grip rubber handle tends to capture water when washed, 2) the plastic molded frame holding the grating surface cracks when washed in the dishwasher, 3) the head is so incredibly sharp that it must be kept covered, yet there is no easy way to due this except for the original tagboard cover. The professional version fixes all of these issues. As you can see, the frame and handle are all stainless steel which eliminates issues #1 #2 and the professional version comes with a nice snap-on plastic cover to protect the sharp head surface. In addition, the rubberized rest on the top of this version can come in very handy. End result: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
I bought this timer, because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had, with the big display and the simple, three-button operation. This particular timer was better priced than most I looked at, and I liked the extra large display. I have been very happy with it. The buttons don't stick like other timers I have used. I like the way the memory feature works, and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice 
I can't believe someone uses this pan to cook eggs! I have tried several cooking oils and butter, and everything sticks to this pan, making it very difficult to clean. My husband won't even use it. I have reverted to my tried and true cast iron pan that never lets me down. Even the cheapo stainless pans I got at Ross are better than this. TERRIBLE 
How many men do you know who rave about irons? Let me tell you this iron is a great buy. Ironing has become a breeze with this product instead of a dreadful hassle. I iron my shirts every day before work and it shows. Ironing was never been my favorite pastitme but now I actually set up time in my day just to use this product! This iron makes every shirt look like i just picked it up from the dry cleaners with its easy to use steam function. You can't beat the price too 
The Polder 5416-97 Essential Dual Leg Ironing Board is easy to lift and to fold. It stores neatly in small spaces. It's sturdy and will last a long time. The cover and pad is very colorful 
Everything sticks to these pans! I cannot get OFF the potato residue and I'm probably just going to throw them away. They are awkwardly heavy. They do not warp, but they do pop out of shape (this happens when the pans are in the oven and you'll hear a very loud, scary pop). Just awful. 
I ordered this thinking that I'd save a bundle, and have a really nice comforter set. Not! The product description promised Navy and Sage, but it is Black and Sage. It is the cheapest looking comforter that I have ever seen. I sent mine back yesterday--I just can't let the seller get away with the totally inaccurate description and the deception in claiming that this product was originally $200+ dollars 
This is the Best Blender I have ever used. It grinds Indian style batter real good. It grabs and churns the mixture quickly. I am using it for the past 5 months, and there has been no problems with it. The jar is plastic and easy to handle and clean. 
I've had this appliance since just before Thanksgiving but only able to fully use it twice. It's very cool the way the egg poacher works with the muffin toaster. BUT when I washed the egg poacher cup, a good bit of teflon came off. (I tried a second time and my poached egg was full of black teflon flakes.) The appliance came with a notice that implored you to please call the Back to Basics if there is a problem (rather than the retailer) so I did. I was told they would send a replacement cup immediately. I can boil eggs in it which is great but you can't toast at the same time so either your toast or your eggs get cold while waiting for the other. As I approached my 30 day return period, I called back and was told that the cups were being redesigned and they would send one out immediately. Today (now 64 days after the first call) I called again and was told that my cup was mailed 10 days ago (but only 7 business days so they won't even discuss tracing or resending until next week). They mailed it from Utah. I live in Seattle. I am so not happy with their service, their attitude and now I'm even getting annoyed at the appliance. Hopefully, no one else will have this problem. But, just in case.. 
This is one of my favorite knives - and I have quite a collection of them, believe me. It's sturdy, sharpens easily, and seems to contour to my hand when chopping. I'm a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife. Great price, I might add. This brand across the board is one of my all-time favorites. I've never been disappointed with a knife I purchased from Victorinox 
I got this to use with the Glorious ONE POT MEALS cookbook. It has wonderful recipies, and the pot works wonderful. Cleans up really easy. Try it, you'll love it. Sharon From Colorad 
cThis is my second bread maker. I bought Cuisinart's one last year and had used it for about a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point. Cuisinart's one has obviously some problems: 1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard. 2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio. 3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts. 4. Some basic cycle have no "Pre-heat" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail. 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula. One of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart's. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things: 1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful. 2. "Pre heat" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more. 3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer. I think I never back to Cuisinart although I miss some points (Sophisticated design or the window on the rid which I can see inside of the case through) of Cuisinart a little bit. I highly recommend this bread maker. 
I made plenty of pizzas on several types of thin metal baking pans, and the results were consistenly mediocre. Now however, with this pizza stone, I no long find myself ordering pizza for delivery. 1 cup water or beer 2 1/2 cups flour (maybe a 1/4-cup of whole-wheat flour mixed in) 1 package of dry yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon butter Knead and let rise twice (I used to do it by hand, but now I have a bread maker which works perfectly for this purpose on the 'dough' setting). This makes two pizzas around 14 inches in diameter. Either roll them out with a rolling pin, or press them into shape by hand. The dough seems to be too elastic to "throw" it into shape - I think it's a skill that takes a long while to master. I make pizza sauce with a can of tomato paste, some red wine and/or water, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chopped onion. I've also used pasta sauce (prego or ragu) with acceptable results. I almost always top with mozarella and thinly-sliced mushrooms. I use parchment baking paper under the pizza. I slide it on and off the stone this way, without resorting to corn meal. This works perfectly for me every time. Heat the oven up _HOT_ (500 degrees). It will only take 5 minutes to bake at this temperature. When the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, it is done. The crust is golden-brown on the bottom, with just a bit of crunch. If I let the crust rise a bit after preparing the pizza, it will be softer and thicker. Store-bought frozen pizzas are also better when cooked on this stone. I'm giving only 4 stars because of the price. There must be a cheaper alternative to this stone, but I'm not complaining too much, because I've thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas it's produced 
Thankyou for the reviews about quality. I wanted to share with krups why I wouldn't buy there panini maker. But when I tried to email customer service it was to complicated to let them know. I also read there warranty and it appears your grills should be covered under one year. But of course it adds at there discretion. I am still deciding which to get but cuisinart has a 3 year warranty 
I've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no-name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago. It is very well broken in with a smooth non-stick patina in all seven indents. I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon, and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies! Therefore, I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to give it a try. I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it's temperature nicely. The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking, but I expected that. I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non-stick surfaces as my old pan (no, it's not for sale!), but I can tell that this pan will get there with use. By the way, I've found that there are many recipes for aebleskivers and several different techniques for cooking them. I'm sure that they all will work well with some practice, but I'll describe the one that I've settled on, because it is so easy: Heat the pan at a medium-low setting. Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix (I use Krusteaz Buttermilk) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar. Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits. Don't overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it. Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent (If you're new to aebleskivers, I recommend trying only three at once.) I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent. After about a minute, I use a knitting needle (or chopstick) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn. I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up. I keep turning them with a spoon until they're done. (You'll just have to break one of them open to check, because it's dependent on your batter and temperature.) Once you get it down (usually after a few rejects), serve them in threes on a small plate with thinned out raspberry jam and powdered sugar. Once you eat them, you'll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball! 
I was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn't want to leave my press laying around where I work (we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea (and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh. I read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through. Well let me say this mug has a double filter, one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from. Coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind. I think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn't know any better and put finely ground coffee in. The mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that, but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug 
this item is priced wrong It is not in line with the other Calphalon item 
product works as described, keeping red and white wines for longer than their normal corked shelf life. case could be a bit more substantial with a higher cosmetic appeal 
We received the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 Cup Coffeemaker as a gift from my sister-in-law. She loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us. Shortly after buying this for us, her coffeemaker started leaking. She thought it was just worn out from the six months of use and purchased a different type to replace hers. We used our BrewStation for the first time yesterday. The night before, I set it up and programmed it to make coffee at 5:00 AM - perfect, we could get up and have coffee already made. It worked great. A minor problem is that I enjoy coffee throughout the morning and the coffeemaker shut off after two hours. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, I just turned it back on and life was good. Now before I go on with my story, I need to explain how this coffeemaker works. You pour the water into the first reservoir (for water only) using the coffee tank to measure the amount of water. The coffee tank is placed back on the coffeemaker and the coffee filter and coffee is placed in a basket that fits on top of the coffee tank. The coffee is made and held in the coffee tank. To dispense the coffee, you place your cup below the tank and push on the dispenser button with your cup. Coffee pours right into the cup. Great idea, too bad it doesn't work as well as the concept! Today coffee was brewed at 5:00 AM again. That's the only thing that worked well. When my husband tried to get a cup of coffee it poured out and would not stop. The cup overflowed, the coffee ran all over the counter and continued to flow until he unplugged it and put the entire coffeemaker in the sink. It finally stopped pouring out when it ran out of coffee. I've cleaned the coffee tank and it continues to pour no matter what I do. Since this coffeemaker runs just under $ 50, the twelve cups of coffee we've made with it very expensive! I've emailed Hamilton Beach and am awaiting an answer to this dilemma. I need to purchase another coffeemaker today and it definitely won't be a Hamilton Beach brand. I can't afford to purchase a new coffeemaker every other day! My advice is to purchase a different brand and stay away from this one. Unless you don't have cups and want to slurp your coffee off of the counter! 
Absolutely horrible! The worst $20 I've every spent. This machine is an absolute waste of money. I have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it, they are all either too wide or too tall. A total headache when your rushing out to work 
We needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room, and after a few months of use, I can say this one is working out very well. It shipped quickly, with no damage (the box was pretty tattered, but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine). It's large for a countertop device, certainly bigger than most microwaves. Be sure to measure your available space, especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site. I hit some minor bumps getting it installed. The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded quick-connect coupler included in the box. The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet, but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose. There's no way for the included adapter to hook up to this, so I wound up having to install a new faucet (this isn't as bad as it sounds, as we were planning to replace the old one anyway). I brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet. Everything seemed okay in the store, but when I got home and installed the new faucet, I had some trouble. It turns out that the included adapter isn't particularly good quality, and didn't fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on. I blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off-the-shelf adapter. Fortunately, it looks like Danby is using all standard-sized parts, so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars. Once I had the thing up and running, it was easy to load and use. The basket is built to hold four full place settings, but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes, mugs, baby cups, storage containers and what have you. The basket insert is removeable, converting it to an all-glasses tray, which we found useful for party cleanup. The machine really heats the water, so dishes come out clean. Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up. I've never had to use the heat-boost "sanitize" setting. It uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid, and you want to be careful NOT to add too much. I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder (spilled a little too much, figured it would just rinse out, oops) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds. This has only happened once and there was no damage. Call it a learning experience. I saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally won't advance when you start running the machine, and this did happen to me once as well after I'd had it for about two weeks. It hasn't recurred since then, either becuase I've been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position, or the timer's "wearing in." Been using it steadily several times a week for a few months now, and after the initial hiccups, it's been working fine. No complaints, and now I'm looking for a Danby under-counter mini-refigerator to replace one in the same rec room. I'd recommend this dishwasher, provided you don't mind a little effort getting it dialed in 
The blade broke after 14 months of use. And to take advantage of the warranty, I learned that I was required to send THEM a check for $4.00 for processing costs, not to mention the cost that I would incurr to ship it to them. It was an adequate grinder at best, so I'm definitely not going to bother returning it (I assume that this is Cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place). I wonder if the rest of their product line is like this. Until now, I thought Cuisinart was a name you could trust. I'm very disappointed 
The first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don't waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer 
You can buy this at Walmart for $78.00. The seller here is charging $89.00 plus $26.00 shipping. You can buy here for 115.00 or go to Walmart and get it for 78.00. Also, seller misquoted price on this item and when he realized this he cancelled my order through amazon.Will not buy from this seller again.This new seller who sells on ebay also is not getting off to a very good start 
I just needed to refute that first review also. This is not a toy, it's not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes (though it will work for SURE). I assume that's what the first reviewer wanted it for. You can get a 19 dollar piece to do that. It's not "about a foot long!" It's 17 inches, and needs to be. It's also not 20 lbs. It's 2 lbs. and it's weight is perfect. It's not a "hand blender" for mixing water. It's an IMMERSION blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses. I'm a professional chef, this is part of my kit that I don't leave home without. You shouldn't be home without it 
I looked for somewhere to find these Corelle plates and found them on Amazon. My favorite dish and plate design should last a while and withstand my abuse 
Had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction (it locked but would not unlock). Amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly. However, the lock on the second one does not work properly, either (it doesn't lock), though I will keep it, since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home. This item is a good way of storing blades and disks, but unless Cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism, don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it. 
I bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly. It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days. We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine. I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now. Few things of note: * Even with Vacu Vin, the wine will start to change flavor if kept over a week. * You do need to pump a lot more than the instruction indicates. Keep pumping until you feel a strong resistance. * Vacu Vin cannot be used for wines with fizz (such as Vino Verde, Champagne, etc). The reduced pressure will suck the gas out of the wine and make it flat very quickly. * It's better to keep the bottle upright so there's no pressure on the rubber stopper (It does not need to stay moist like a cork). Its purpose is to keep a leftover wine until you finish it, and it does that quite well 
Bought one recently from a Mervyns sale. Rice burned especially at the bottom (black crunchy). So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective. Nope, did the same thing. So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time. For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker. Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it. Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup. Hopefully they'll improve it. Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker 
It leaked from the bottom seam the first time I used it. But I guess you get what you pay for. 
I have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best! Heavy (but not too heavy to use) so the handles don't bend (or float around in the dishwasher), shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily, easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away (they are engraved). I love my set...will definately buy another set (cooking is my hobby) 
i have wanted a crockpot for a long time and this one was one of the cheaper ones i saw. i've read reviews about rival before but decided to go ahead and try it out. i really wish i would have kept my receipt and box!. the lid doesn't even fit and moves around most of the time making a bunch of noise and letting all the steam escape so all your liquid ends up being gone. the food is well done before the slow time is up. my chicken turns out SO dry and overcooked. 
When I received this coffee maker, it worked long enough for me to run water through it to clean it out, then then heating element stopped working. It took numerous calls to Braun, then of course I had to pack it up and ship it off. Several weeks later it was returned to me and once again, it worked one time. Again, it took several phone calls and I had to pack it up and send it off again. I received a new unit that does indeed heat up, but has several other problems. The drip shut-off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks, the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee, and if one uses a paper filter, it tends to overflow the filter basket. This is the worst coffee maker I've ever owned 
Calphalon Katana knives excel in balance, efficient design, sharpness, and in good looks. I look forward to using them every time I prepare food 
I purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about $7 each. The latest probe just malfunctioned. I really loved it at first...perfectly roasted chickens,loin roasts, and turkeys. Oddly enough, the thermometer works great but the probe itself isn't designed to handle much time in the oven. If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven ,the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable. Even at lower temperatures, the heat finally takes its' toll...it just takes longer for it to happen. One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat. I will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working, it is great. That is worth $7 a year for me....but not for everyone. Per another reviewers advice, I am calling Polder 
I was really looking forward to receiving this, but four weeks after purchasing online, I received an email from Amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase! I am disappointed in Amazon. How can you sell something you do not have 
This thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine's been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they'd bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that's not possible. 
The item was not what I expected. The description said metal but it should have said "Tin" 
This product is great for making mashed potatoes. I love it, it is well made and sturdy. My kids like to turn the handle and I do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers. The price is very good for this item. I prefer non electric kitchen gadgets, (to save space) and this one is great. 
Twenty bucks for three name brand skillets is a great price. They are not part of Farberware's higher end line (obviously from the price. any educated consumer will recognize and admit this.) The bottom line is that they do what they're supposed to do. We are replacing a very heavy Revereware Non-stick pan my wife bought 1.5 years ago. The teflon wa flaking off. She had paid $45 for it. we decided that most of the supermarket non-stick frying pans we've had over the years lasted 1-2 years and they were usually $13-20. This Farberware set is a great value 
I'm sure that you will love this set as much as my family and I do! Each piece is durable and good looking! My original set was also by Sango, and I gave it away after 20 years only because my decor had changed dramactically. Now my neighbor is enjoying my original service for 12. I expect to enjoy my new Gold Dust set for at least, the next 20 years 
Mine didn't hold up either. For what I paid for it, I expected more. One I picked up for around twenty is doing a much better job and lasted through more than four uses. 
Pictures on-line don't come close to the beauty of the set. The tea pot is large! The set is worth every penny I paid and then some. I checked other web sites and the price for this set was $150 up to $225. Buy it, you can't find it for less I shopped around prior to making my purchase! I rate the set a 10+ for the size of the pieces as well as Barrons quick shipping of my purchases. ALL have arrived fast and in excellent, excellent condition. Barrons does an outstanding job on their packaging to protect the pieces during shipping 
Well, I just got my blender, real excited to use it, filled it up with the ingredients, flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking, badly, and then died. I turned it off and tried to turn it on again, and all it did was make a grumbly noise. So I am sending it back and sticking with my old Hamilton that I have had for 9 years. Why did I quit using it in the first place. $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie. $79 for this Waring and it crashed and burned on me. My advice is it looks nice, but it isn't worth the money, especially since it died right away on me. Oh well... 
How do YOU cleave your meat? I cleave my meat by meat cleaving it with a meat cleaver 
Just bought this item this week, was very excited about using it for the first time. Turned out to be a huge mess. The stove turned black right under the grill, it took like 20 min to clean it up, burned up mess. Also there there is soo much smoke coming from the grill I had to shut off the smoke detector for a while. Overall the food came out pretty good but the mess with the stove really upset me. 
The machine leaked after we poured in the liquid ingredients.The mix in dispenser did not operate properly, all we put in were sprinkles. The ice cream did not harden enough until about 25 minutes;kids cannot wait that long.We could of driven to the local ice cream store and back by this time. Save your money,buy a old fashion ice cream maker instead at least your kids will get a workout and be occupied at the same time 
Well constructed, good lid fit and solid handles. The cover handle gets very hot in use but this is to be expected as it is metal. The saucepan handle is quite narrow and if wet, or greasy, could be annoying to handle when draining the pan (although I have not had this problem with any of the pans in this range). All in all, I think this is excellent valu 
These are the best ones I have seen so far. You'll love the martini design! A great bargain 
This kettle is very stylish with modern detailing. The removable whistle and stay-cool handle are added pluses. Its smooth lines make it very easy to clean, and its contemporary shape makes it especially attractive 
I have the four piece set of these silicone utensils, and have been very pleased with them. They are heat resistant, heavy-duty, and look sharp. They are slightly flexible, but I have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner. The best part is the wonderful easy-clean properties of the silicone. My other heat-resistant utensils always look icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish. These look great right out of the dishwasher! I've had them for a year and they've held up great. The turner has not disintegrated on the edge, either, like many other types do. The smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you're cooking 
We received 3 sets of this for a wedding present. I really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand. However, after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots. After two more washes the rust got worse. These are supposed to be dishwasher safe! There are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them, but who has the time for that these days? Despite the apeal of the set, we decided to try something else. It's a shame because it's such a pretty set (before the wash of course!). 
I went to Amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems. Yes, deLonghi makes a great product. No, this is not one of them. I have read the directions so often I have them memorized, and I can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit. I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs. I hope that is not the problem, but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews. So...who else bought this unit from Costco? Because if that is the problem I'll bet Costco will be all over deLonghi to fix it. Until then, this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning, every day 
Even if entering the kitchen gives you hives, this spoon can make it easier. It's balanced, easy to use and easy to clean and store. It goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion...WITHOUT spilling, breaking like some of the el-cheapo brands. If you care for this spoon - it will serve you well for many years. My first one - I used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with (in?) the blender. Been searching for one ever since to replace - and at this price I am buying several 
I struggled through many pages of product reviews and descriptions before I finally decided to purchase this particular brand. Why? Because I didn't have a clue on which brand was good or bad, many of the reviews for mushroom/egg slicers were mixed, so I took a stab in the dark, and came up a winner!! This is a great product, stores easily, and works well. The curve where you put the mushroom (or egg) is just the right size and is just a wonderful time saver! I love it 
Unfortunately, if you have an older gas oven like we do, the temperature of your oven may actually be higher than the temperature at which you set it on the dial. This led to problems determining a safe temperature in which to use the trays. We were all hesitant to eat the muffins I'd made because of the chemical/plastic smell. I'm back to using foil muffin cups on a cookie sheet 
I have read a few reviews about this machine and some how I am not sure what I missed. I purchased this machine about 8 months ago. I loved the look of it in my kitchen with all my stainless appliances. That is where it ends. This machine has been terrible, when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered. When your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow, making more for you to clean up. I just want coffee!!! Even though the inside "unit" that holds the coffee does come out, it is not designed to fit into the front of a refrig to put water in it. You have to use something else to catch the water from the refrig then dump that into this machine. They put little time into the design/research of this machine. I hesitate to add this as I don't want anyone reading this to think my home is dirty....living in Florida we tend to see Palmetto bugs. This machine has about 5 vent holes in the top of it, I had two bugs get in the machine. They had full access to the water reservior. Once I filled the water reservior the bugs came flying out. That was the end of this machine for me. POOR DESIGN ISSUES and not sanitary by any means. LOOK ON! 
This roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment. It is heavy duty and I have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey. It is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting; the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast I could fit in my oven. It washes clean with little effort so I have not had to use the dishwasher. It looks like new after washing. This pan will be around a lot longer than I will! 
This machine does not make clear ice, just like your in-refrigerator does not make clear ice. Also, please read consumer reviews about function 
Awesome garlic press for a great price. No need to peel garlic and it's easy to clean 
This Toastmaster breadmaker is pretty basic, makes a good-sized loaf and is really easy to use. If the first loaf isn't perfect, the troubleshooting section of the book tells you how to correct the problems and the corrections work. It's been in use constantly for weeks now and never fails to produce a good loaf 
Everyone who comes in and sees this just loves it. I'm getting several for Christmas presents this years to give to all my friends. I mounted mine over the sink because that is where I do most of my slicing and dicing. It also keeps my knives sharper because you're not sliding them in and out of the wood blocks. It even holds my knife sharpener 
Only had this coffee maker ( second replacement) one year and it leaked from all over my counter. I asked for a replacement, crazy huh, and was told NO my time had run out. Well I am off on a hunt for a good coffee maker. THIS WAS NOT IT !! Do not waste your money 
I have always had a percolator so having cuisinart products and another percolator by them I ordered this one. I received it the first of Sept. 2006 and on Nov. 10 plugged it in, it sparked at the pot and that was it GONE!! I am sick about this as I had thought Cuisinart was a step above the rest 
OK, for twenty bucks it works reasonably well. We like the storage container to hold the attachments. But if you're looking for a lower speed to blend ingredients like flour or pancake mix, buy something else. The #1 speed setting is way too fast. Anything higher than #4 will decorate your kitchen walls "at no extra charge". 
Don't be fooled by this apparently well-designed grater. The hinge is weak and will break. The grater looks and feels great, but don't expect it to last 
It's great, if it works!!! After keep exchanging it over and over, I gave up the 5th time. First time, spray didn't work, second time, power steam button didn't release the steam, third time, it was too strong fabric got stock underneath the iron and I couldn't clean the iron, fourth time, steam problem again, fifth time, steam problem again. Poorly tested product. I would've been really happy to keep it, if it was working properly. It actually had all the features I was looking for. Too bad for Rowenta for not testing their products properly. 
I really like this tea press. It is the perfect size for one person. 
The knives are great, dishwasher safe, cut beautifully. A bargain at the price. But a nicer, more permanent box would be nice 
Last year, I bought a Pizza Stone from Pampered Chef. It was a rousing success with my family. For the 5 of us, however, one stone was not enough and I wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time. Sadly, the product did not come through. My pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off. I tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time. It stuck even worse! The pizza didn't get fully done in the middle, while the Pampered Chef pizza was perfect both times. I will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from Pampered Chef. You get what you pay for!! 
I was so looking forward to this machine. I am a long time machine bread maker and have had two other brands with not a problem. First, Yes it burns the crust on MED; Second, I made 4, count them, four batches of their recipe bread and my recipe bread and they were ALL awful. Could not believe it. Each time I followed the reciped and instructions to the letter. I'm giving up the ghost and going back to my el cheapo bread machines that work every time. Love the style and the loaf shape of the Cuisinart but don't like wasting my time and ingredients. Maybe I got a lemon 
"I think It's cleaning itself" says my wife as she was soaking it in the sink after we baked mac and cheese. It seemed like it was. I gave it a quick scrub with a songe and it was clean. No need to soak it really. This is the best folks, skip the Le Creuset and go for this. If you want to save some bucks go for the Cuisinart Chef Clasics (see my review on that 
The old OXO tea kettles had a train whistle sound. This new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you couldn't hear it in the next room. Save your money and buy something cheaper. It will work as well if not better. I returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too. 
After 5 washings, these towels still shed like a mother. Grrr 
I bought this juicer last week from a local store. It is impossible to keep it steady when you use it. You are luckY if you get the half of the juice in the glass! The juice is all over the place. The unit started to make a loud noise after 2 days. I will return it this weekend and get my money back. STAY AWAY! 
i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years - mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me - you don't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i'm returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep - not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren't firm - any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer's housing seems like it weighs a ton - you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won't regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i'll do the right thing and get another 
We have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust. PROS: Retro Stylish. Inexpensive compared to quality flatware. CONS: Very poorly made, Expensive if you need to replace 1/3 of flatware ever year 
The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous. The handle is much too small for this size mug. If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware. The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves. Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware 
I purchased this product because I have recently starting baking cookies and stirring cookie dough by hand left my arm and shoulder sore. I know Kitchenmaid as a quality product name. Instead of the large mixer I opted for this handheld model because I don't have alot of counter top or space. It is light, easy hold and powerful enough for the toughest chocolate chip cookie dough. I am happy with it. I was also happy with the delivery of the product...it arrived within the week and was well package to prevent damage 
These cup are enormous! (Not to mention beautiful, in that fun and elegant way that only Fiestaware can be.) I was looking for a very large, oversized mug because I drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly. I definately got my wish. I have eaten soup and cereal out of these, I even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently. Very cute! I plan on getting them in all of the six colors I have in Fiestaware. Let me tell you again, this cup is HUGE 
this item is too big and very difficult to operate. it is the worst breville product purchased. the panni press does the same thing without the difficult cleaning. i would NOT recommend this item...too much money...definately NOT worth the cost 
I have never written an online review for a product before, but I am so annoyed by this dumb sifter that I just had to. I am not a "speed" baker of any sort, but I have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes, muffins, cookies, etc. My old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour, so I started looking for a new one. I chose this one after reading all the online reviews, and even though I saw that a few people found it slow, I was not prepared for how slow it really is! I just sifted 3+ cups of confectioner's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes. As another reviewer said, in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired. (I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before, fer' pete's sake!!!) I'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter. I'm stuck with the thing now, I suppose, so I'll learn to just go slower. But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side. The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I'm surprised nobody else has come up with. But that doesn't redeem the product for me. In fact, if I can put my hands on another one of those old-fashioned ones (at a thrift store, maybe) I'll snap it up and put this new one in the Goodwill bin. 
I love garlic and this has been the best garlic press. I've use this almost every day for the last 6 months and it still works and looks great! It's definately worth the money 
I have a set of mid-range Henckels that I bought some years ago, and they are -much- better than this. I bought this set for my daughter because they were a good compromise between quality and price, and she won't ruin then in the dishwasher. I would have thought that Henckels wouldn't make any actual crap, but this set comes awfully close. The good thing is, boy are they sharp. But there's bad things too. Only the 8" chef's knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all, the rest are -very- thin and flimsy. 'Laser-cut' edges are overrated - make them another millimeter thick please, so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction. A good knife is an extension of the cook's intention - it does what you want, and does NOT require thought and pre-conception and compensation in every cut. (...)is waaay too much for one adequate chef's knife and some toys. Very disappointed in Henckels, and in Amazon too, I don't feel I got what I ordered. 
yes, it looks good in my blue kitchen. but the water doesn't pour cleanly out of the spout - it's more like uncontrollable spewing, even when "poured" slowly, and boiling water splashes all over the counter. also very difficult to fully empty. sorry I threw out the box, or I'd send back 
The most important quality of this tea pot is that it pours well; it does not drip nor does the water overflow the spout when filling the pot. I am very happy with my purchase 
As mentioned in a lot of other reviews, my water tank leaks like a sieve. the unit is completely unusable. When you see how poorly constructed the water tank is, you realize Hoover has built a clearly defective product. Save yourself trouble, buy another brand of cleaner. I will never buy a Hoover product again 
I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed. It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble. The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket. I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star. 
Stop Be For You Buy!!!! Should have saved my money. Making pasta with this machine is disappointing. The recipe given with the instructions is way to sticky to run through the extruder. I redid the dough 3 times before I was able to extrude it, and still it stuck together. I should have listened to the rest of the reviews, but having owned a pasta maker/extruder before I thought it would be a piece of cake. If I were you I would invest in the roller pasta maker for you mixer. On the bright side though...The food grinder is wonderful 
We have only been using the sheets for 2 months and it is already pilling (balling up) very badly. It is already affecting my husbands sleep so we are on a search for another sheet set. When you see 500 thread count, you expect more from the sheet but I guess we should have know what to expect given the low price. I suppose you get what you pay for. Take my advice and don't throw away this $$ 
I have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex. Until now. Last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400F oven, my pyrex dish exploded. It rained glass all over the inside of my oven. It was a disaster. I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time. This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM! 
the glass cover fits well. the heavy bottom distributes heat well. the ease of cleaning is wonderful. it's a great addition to our kitchen 
Although I ONLY hand washed these pots and pans, somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd year, the nonstick coating on the pans started lifting. I also do not use metal cooking utensils. All that being said, I still use these pots and pans (been almost 5 years now). Overall, I originally bought this set for ~$300 5 years ago. The pots are still in excellent condition. If I was looking for pots and pans, I would consider purchasing another set at $150. I do cook a lot (used for business) so my 5 years with these pans may equate to 7-10 years of normal use 
After many years of buying and discarding inferior knife sharpeners I have finally found one that sharpens even my dullest knives. 
The Villaware Panini Grill has proved to be a very useful appliance, so much so that I leave it out on the counter - it's quite attractive, and certainly not an eyesore. I use it often, for grilled sandwiches, of course, but also for grilled meats and fish. I would caution users to avoid meat with bones, e.g. lamb chops(you can't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill), and to be very careful about timing: things get done twice as fast! While the cleaning "comb" is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill, you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately; much easier to do if the grill is warm (not hot). I haven't tried grilling vegetables, yet, but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way, or eggplant, or peppers. I am very happy with the quality of this product 
I have had the blue ecopods for well over a year now. Ilove the taste of the coffee and it does give a fair amount of foam but hard to clean. I saw the Presto MyPod and leaped to try it. The coffee overfills the cup making it too weak and no room for creamer. There is absolutely no foam. I got hooked on the Senseo Foam. We will use it in a pinch but only on the 1 cup setting with 1 1/2 scoops 
I loved this bread machine, but it broke after owning it for about three years. My husband took it apart to try to fix it, but could not repair it. It was making bread and just turned off. We could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem. We now have to replace it. It worked great until it just stopped working. I think a breadmaker should last longer then three years. Also, I did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough, so I couldn't just program it and leave the house 
As soon as I opened it and tried to remove the lid for cleaning, it broke! No instructions provided on how to remove, replace the removable parts 
I recently got this set and the 2 piece carving set of the same series. I know I should not have expected much for this great price, but the knives do not have anywhere as good a feel as the classic line of wusthof or the henckels 4 or 5 star knives. They are very light in weight, mostly due to the handles. Much better than a target or kmart knife, and great to start, but I expect to switch mine out with 'real' knives as my budget will allow 
the furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you're lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain. also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier. after waiting and waiting, and calling target on several occasions, someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications. quite honestly, this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth. by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax, this is not so much a "deal" but a waste of time and money. 
This unit does everything it is designed to do. Have used it several times now and the only question we have is, when do we change the oil? ..... we think it's kinda like your car, if it looks and smells bad .... dump it ... grin ! 
My husband, (a Jaguar lover), calls this the "E-Type of Toasters"! It is beautifully designed; requires minimal space and is 'simply' sophisticated. To achieve the "perfect toast" using our old toaster required toasting a slice of bread three times, turning it twice, - now it's one single click. Kitchen appliances wouldn't be hidden away inside the cabinet if they were designed as elegantly as Braun's Impressions Toaster 
I received this tea kettle as a replacement for a Nova teakettle (the former model) that I purchased in October 2005. Part of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it, and Breville is excellent in this area. My former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch. I notified the company by email, and I received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail. In 3 more hours, I received an email with a fed-x label. They indicated they wanted to see the product, and they would either repair or replace it. Within a week, I had this new model as a replacement, since they no longer make the Nova. I then received a follow up phone call from Breville to make sure I got and liked the new product, which I do. The warranty period for the new product starts again, so it has a full one year warranty. I also asked about the switch, since I was concerned that this could be a problem, and they assured me that this is a problem they just don't have with the applicances. The customer service rep indicated that in 10 years, he had seen about 6 of the type of problem I had. It seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company. The new kettle heats quickly and to a full boil. It also has the sharp looks where you can use for entertaining. I am happy with the product, and very happy with the company's service 
I have purchased these plates from Amazon in the past and the earlier plates were made in England. So, I ordered more to go along with my current set to find that now they are made in India and were not of the same quality as those made in England. I sent them back. I will say that had I not already had the more detailed colorful items, I might have appreciated these of lesser quality more than I did. 
I like the amazon customer service as they replaced my order when I got the damaged one 
I love these oven mitts. They have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator, or other metal surface. They are not as cumbersome as the really long, heavily molded ones. I bought them for all of my grown children and they all love them too. 
I have used analon cookware since 1997. The handle came off one of the saucepans. Before I could return it, my husband tossed it out. I replaced the saucepan and purchased some additional items. They arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. I have used the pots and they have met my expectations. I would like to order some of the other accessories. 
The only thing I do not like of this pitcher is its lid. The lid is not quite sealed so that the water could leak from the back and wet your sleeve. Even worse, sometimes the lid fell off. You have to be careful while using it. Not recommend 
These are not Farberware, but Hoan -- which makes cut-rate kitchen implements like knives, measuring cups etc. I sent these as a gift, and was hugely embarrassed when I showed up for dinner and found out I'd sent this junk.This is deceptive advertising at its worst -- shame on you, Amazon! 
Mine died after 6 months - half the heating elements stopped working, toasting only one side of the bread. Took it apart - no loose or broken wires, so must have been the circuitry. Chucked it in the garbage. While it was working, it would jam easily. The push-down handle has a flimsy metal tang that twists easily (when kids or oafish adults use it). The tang then rubs against the slot, incinerating the toast 
These tools, although fun looking, are poorly balanced and fall over if they don't have enough room to rest on the counter. The handles are a little awkward in size and the bowls of the spoons slightly too deep. I like their look, but I don't like the design of them 
And bit the dust. I use it once a year for 3 days. I'm estimating it made coffee 10 times. Now it wont brew anything but weak coffee. If you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew. Now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak. I was going to call Faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute. For what? Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away. At least I wont be thrwing away 150 bucks 
I have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother. She had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime. When I found the Kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere $4.97 at my local Sears, I snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen. It's not a bad cookie press, but it's definitely not the best out there, I'm sure...and it doesn't stack up at all to my mother's old-fashioned one. As stated in another review, many discs don't seem to work at all well with this press. I tried the tree, candy cane, and star discs and every single one just squirted out an uneven messy blob. Somehow the press pushed out the dough unevenly out of the press, so that one side of the shape was a blob while the other side was barely out of the press. The rosette, swirl, and ribbon shapes did fairly well, though they turned out much larger shapes than the older model I'm used to...hence extending the baking time of the cookies. I'm used to nice, thin, crispy ribbons, but this press turned out very thick ones. I was also not very fond of the ratcheting style of the press. It felt as though I had less control over it than the squeeze-gun type. If I'd paid full price for this press, I would have been a bit upset at the quality, but having paid only $5 for it, I'm just disappointed because I had thought Kitchenaid to be a better quality brand than what I've seen in this cookie pres 
I hope these things are airtight because I just bought my fourth set. I don't buy the freezer storage containers because I own these. They can be used in cooking and freezing so I save on pricey disposable freezer bags. The little ones I use to store one package each of corn starch, yeast, baking powder, baking soda, three hamburger patties and to prepare, freeze and bake individual sized servings of salmon fillets. The medium ones and the large ones are for leftovers, soup fixings, freezer meals, steaming chicken, fruit salad et al. I'm ten percent tempted to try out the rectangular ones because some foods I don't want to freeze in a stack but I don't think I would get as much use out of them as I do these round ones. I really would like to buy a fifth set but I won't. I rarely have more than one or two empty ones to spare. These get used all the time. I really didn't like using plastic wrap or aluminum foil to refrigerate food. These lids are more secure and therefore I am less stressed 
I jumped on purchasing this machine when I saw it. I was tired of storing beans in the freezer. I put 4 AA batteries in it and a pound of beans, closed the lid and the sucking sound started...and it kept going, and kept going, and kept going. I started looking for places to store it so that it wouldn't wake me up at night or disturb me with it's annoying hum first thing in the morning. But I didn't have to worry, but the next morning the batteries were dead. I replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again! There is no place to plug it in so you're stuck with using batteries. I'm going to try buying rechargables but I don't know how long I'm going to want to keep this replacement going!! P.S. I found it interesting that after I post my negative review three 5 star reviews appear from people who have no review history and NONE of them address the battery issue. Sur La Table, is sending me a new unit but told me that they received an identical complaint about the battery life. Be wary. I'll try to update you 
This is a pretty good timer with two timing capability, but the only complaint I have with it is that you have to push a minimum of four different buttons just to stop the timer and get it to stop the led screen from flashing. However, it has very nifty features and the sound of the timer is not too irritating. Also, the five minute warning is very useful 
Have had it for three years but haven't used it much. The times I have used it, it has worked very well. Dislikes: Cant tell when it is done boiling the water. There is no indicator. The only way is to hear the switch click from on to off. Also, there is a min and max line for the amount of water needed to use. However, very hard to see so I used a Sharpee to highlight on the outside. Would be nice if it had cup indicator markings or other markings to tell you how much water you are boiling 
I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. The first time it arrived, after 3 weeks, it was in about 1,000 pieces. The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this 
If the probe was not so fragile I'd give this unit 5 stars. The remote works well although I have had it lose contact with the sender if I was out in front of my house (my grill is on the back deck). This is a minor annoyance, but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed (indicating "HIGH" reading) in conditions where my MIU France unit keeps on going. Unfortunately the MIU France unit doesn't have the remote capability. I purchased about 5 extra probes for the Taylor unit directly from Taylor by mail. But within a few weeks several of those failed. I don't mind having to replace a probe once in a while but when you have to replace two in one cooking session it gets pretty annoying. I'd suggest staying away from this unit 
My husband sweats a lot at night and I thought this would stop the problem. It didn't at all. It doesn't seems like it does anything for me either. It just feels like a normal mattress pad. Not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad 
I ordered all three colors of these mugs - red, blue and white. The blue and white mugs have a shiny, even glaze. The red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish, giving it a more rustic, country look. The mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really don't match each other. 
I should have listened when the other reviewers said to stay away from this steamer. Now I wish I had spent the extra $60 and gotten one from Jiffy. The box the unit arrived in was pretty beat up and did not look like it had been professionally taped. It definitely looked like it had been returned by another customer, and lucky me, I got sloppy seconds. I read the instructions and assembled it carefully, but the performance is just awful. Even after letting it heat up for two minutes and then holding the trigger for 30 seconds, as the instructions indicate, it lets out a pathetic gasp of steam. Additionally, it sprays out great gobs of water all over the clothes, and I don't mean a few spots of water like you get with any steamer 
All Coffee grinders leave a bit of a mess so don't let the comments about stray grinds deter you. All the reviewers who used flavored beans need to be discounted since that is not recommended. Others seem to have trouble with the "door" which is really just a deflector for the grind. You get a few grinds on the counter but that is a small price to pay for delicious fresh coffee. Th A-9 has a strong relatively quiet motor (which means it is still loud, but not as loud as most other burr grinders0 and takes up very little counter space. The glass hopper for the beans seals at the top with a scrw on lid. I love the idea of the measuring cup which saves a lot of time scooping. It eliminates that step...just grind until you have the right amount and dump it into your coffee basket. Kitchen Aid has a nice Pro model that costs twice as much by why pay more for less 
This sifter broke a month after I got it. It seems sturdy but it actually requires carefull handling. The sifting is somewhat slow but good (excercise!!!) 
This product would not cut through a sweet potato. It barely went through a piece of a regular potato. While cutting through a potato it was bending and felt like it would break. It's fairly cheap, but you get what you pay for. I ended up using a knife instead. It's your $8.99.. 
we got this as a wedding gift and it worked ok for about 2 years, but there are 2 plastic parts that have broken in the last month making it unusable. would not recommend this machine or this brand to anyon 
I ordered this item when it was not available at that time so it took a while for me to get it-but I was impressed at the careful packing and the product itself-very elegant looking cake set and can be used as a punch bowl too-would certainly recommend it for all hosts 
This is the best cooling rack I have ever seen. I have used it primarily for cookies, but it works great for other baked goods as well. Because of the small grid, nothing gets bent or broken. The size is perfect for putting many cookies on to cool without trying to squeeze them together. Clean up is a breeze. Just add a couple of recipes and this would make a very nice gift. I know I wouldn't want to be without it 
I picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it. The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own. I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail. It might be hard to see from the picture, but the "holes" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser. The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas. I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product. In my case they make me want to break it 
I received my food processor for Christmas. I had noticed the same processor at a different store that came with a bonus blade for fine shredding. I decided to see if I could buy accessories for mine online. I could not find any accessories or replacement parts for the Power Pro II. I was concerned about the number of unfavorable reviews I came across during my search. Despite the numerous negative comments concerning the motor going out, I decided to keep it. I used it for the first time tonight to make a sauce and was only halfway finished when it stopped working! I strongly recommend NOT purchasing this food processor 
I was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived; way too large for my countertop at least; it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth; it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly; I mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food; nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill; the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product. It is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets 
Works great! Makes small amounts of delicious coffee! Very handy 
This is the simplest, but one of the best kitchen must haves I have purchased in a long time. The peel is whisked of the garlic in seconds. Easy to clean, easy to store. No more garlic hands 
I got this pasta maker as a gift, and after the first use the knob used to set the thickness of the pasta broke off and so did a piece of the handle used to turn the rollers. All it would make after that is a flat piece of pasta with varying thickness. The company is going to charge me to send it to them and back, even if they decide to exchange the product, and all correspondences must be done by mail (no call-in number) so I'm not even hopeful for an exchange 
The International Eversharp line is Henckels low-end, stamped stainless line. It is not carbon steel. It is not hand-forged. It does not compare to the other Henckels lines which are. You get what you pay for. These are cheap knives. This is the first time I have seen a set of Henckels knives which could go in the dishwasher....but, that's because on this line, you do not get Henckels lifetime warranty (which is voided by dishwasher use) 
I used La Cloche to make bread with, specifically San Francisco Sourdough, with SPECTACULAR results. The crust was crisp but chewey, and I could not imagine baking another loaf without it. But after I used it the first time, the bottom developed a crack. After a second use, the crack became so large that I will not use it again for fear it will break during cooking. I called Sassafras Enterprises (800.537.4941), and for $8.00 to cover shipping/handling they are sending out a replacement bottom. Their customer service was outstanding, and I feel they build a quality product. I also purchased the rectangular version of La Cloche, and I have not had an issue. Perhaps our La Cloche was damaged during shipping. I would have rated it 5 stars otherwise 
I have had the knife for a month, and now it is simply not sharp. The knife does NOT hold it's edge, and I have used it only on soft vegetables a few times. Acceptable at $19, but hardly high quality 
We've only used them once, so can't comment on longevity, but our initial use was great. No odor or fumes as other people have reported. Even though we forgot to spray it, the muffins came out clean and easy. The tray is a definite plus! We got two different Roshco silicon pans, and it does seem that baking times and temps may need to be slightly adjusted and is probably what let to some of the complaints people have listed 
As of today August 19, I have not received anything on this plan. No paperwork,no backorder....NOTHING !!! I think maybe it's just a rip-off 
The Petstep II Multi-Purpose Dog Sately Ramp was perfect for getting my black Lab, Blake, out of the water and over our sea wall. He is over 90 pounds and it was sturdy and supported his weight. He is very appreciative and so am I! I would highly recommend this product and the seller selling it. 
I thought "KitchenAid" this has to be a keeper. I was wrong. The handles are much too heavy. There's too much give with the spatulas. I find the utensils to be too bulky and uncomfortable. I'll stick to my other much cheaper temperature regulated utensils 
These sheets are wonderful and very well made. I really like they way they feel. Great, great value! 
I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited. On the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk 
I thought it was me but every time that I lift the cover on this oven, there is this strange rotting smell. It doesn't seem to matter what has been in there, either. No matter what food...same rotting smell. In fact, whenever I lift the cover, my wife goes running from the room holding her nose, screaming about how disgusting it is. 
Works well, well built and easy to clean. Have no problems after a few months of use 
For ideal coffee using a French press is the best method. It takes a bit more time and effort, but results in much better tasting coffee. This is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact. This adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise. As for this French press in particular: size does matter. If you make enough coffee that you aren't drinking by the single mug then just get a bigger press. I drink about a pot and half of coffee most week days and find the effort required to use this smaller press a hassle. As such I just keep this press at home and only use it in the evenings. 
I received this a shower gift a few years ago. Standard mixer, can't do anything too drastic with it, but I noticed the last time I took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted. These are not stainless beaters and they will rust. I'm in the market for a new mixer 
This is a very nice set of small measuring spoons-- excellent for measuring baking soda, salt, etc for recipes. They are very sturdy and much better than the inexpensive plastic products you find at the discount stores. This set also comes with 2 things not shown, a nice ring to loop these together, as well as a matching S hook to hang them up when not in use. I really like this set and would recommend this to everyone 
I LOVE THIS BREADMAKER! IT IS SO EASY TO USE AND MAKES DELICIOUS LOAVES OF BREAD. IT DOESN'T TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE IN THE KITCHEN AND ALL OF MY ROOMMATES LOVE USING IT TOO. SUPER AWESOME 
This set looks gr8 only in the foto. In reality, it has a very dull look. Not worth buying. I got 2 queen sets and greatly disappointed with this purchase from Amazon! Price is cheap, so is the quality of the Comforter set! 
I bought this item in October 2005, by January it had developed a crack across the bottom and up the side of the pitcher. I contacted both Amazon and Emile Henry about it. Amazon will only give a partial refund and Emile Henry told me to go through the merchant and DID NOT offer that supposed warranty on their shoddy product. Don't buy this piece of junk 
I, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all 
This is a cheap piece of junk. The base won't communicate with the remote even after extensive review of directions and trying different channel selections as directed. The plastic housings are so lightweight I don't think it'd survive ordinary outdoor use either. Certianly not a drop off your grill. Felt like I had to handle it gingerly so I didn't crush it with my hands. This one is going back -Sorry AZ. 
Purchased this, expecting better functionality. Sure it doesn't rust, but my $5 Wustoff pealer works much better 
I purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside. It looks very nice and clean up is super easy. The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it. The first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke. This is great, I thought. The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either) I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more. It was not a pleasant experience. Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try. If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe 
This little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt. All in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you 
I have used this jigger several times a week since I got it back in November, and I think it's great. I often make a second round with it. It is difficult to remove the top with the jigger on, but otherwise it comes off fine as long as you open it up right after you make and pour a round of drinks 
I have used every major brand of cutlery and I can tell you there is no better value than analon knives. I have been cooking and managing restuarants for over 30 years and I have found that the $100 knives are no better than thr $25 ones. The analon product looks and feels just as nice as the most expnesive brands out there and is one third the price. Try them you will love them. I might add that all knives have to be reground from time to time as the edge will become blunt and no sharpener will restore it. When this happens find a local grinding service and have them restored. A good knife can last you a lifetime if you take care of it happy chopping Mik 
As a tea lover for 30 years, I have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost-benefit and performance. I've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it's still working perfectly. It boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while. A+ 
Took what I thought would be a nice set of sheets to my place in Costa Rica and have slept in wrinkles ever since. Hard to maintain, color is not vivid and am overall disappointed with this 600 thread count sheet set. 
Firstly this set arrived with the small lid broken. Amazon of course sent a replacement set but then the large lid was broken on that one. I now have my full set however it feels kind of thin and fragile. It's an ok buy but when the time comes to replace them I'll be looking for something a bit more durable 
I have been grinding my own coffee beans every morning for many years and have gone through quite a few different grinders. I have always loved Cuisinart products and was very excited to purchase this one, what a mistake! The grinder itself is really noisy and heavy for it's size. The coffee grinds are never fine enough for my liking and they get stuck up inside the plastic top, making a huge mess and wasting a lot of coffee. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE!! 
This iron worked splendidly for over year before almost catching on fire while I was using it. I was pressing a shirt when suddenly the LED display on the iron shut off and started beeping repeatedly. I smelled smoke and the handle was hot to the touch. I lifted the iron off my shirt to discover a dark scorch mark ON MY BRAND NEW SHIRT! I do NOT recommend this iron -- you risk burning your clothes 
3 swipes and your knife is sharp on both sides of the edge. The sharpener folds up neatly into a little case the size of a man's wallet and is easy to store. The Handy House ships immediately..I got my package within 3 days. I love the knife sharpener, and love the service I received. Thank 
This pan heats up evenly, no hot or cool spots, and the handles stay cool. It's great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs. Cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to High, and so far, it hasn't been necessary. Very good value. 
I find this iron very easy to use. The multiple steam holes makes ironing easier and faster. I have a small problem with it spitting water. I have tried using 1/2 tap and 1/2 spring water and I have tried adjusting the steam flow, but it still tends to spit. Overall, I am very pleased with this iron. 
My old blender went kaput it was a kenmore. We decided to buy this blender since it also had a small food processor. The food processor has become our most frequently used tool. Preparing salsa, omlettes, indian food which requires vegetables chopped into small pieces, pancakes and numerous other tasks have become so easy that we make more vegetarian dishes now and they taste better since the pieces are well and evenly chopped. Really enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc. Unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better. I recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor. 
Regardless of the setting you use, you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds. In addition, the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work. Be prepared to grind more than you need, and then measure the grounds (somehow avoiding the powder) yourself. 
What A JOKE!!! This whas a disappointing experience. The Garment Steamer never really worked. I wasted a valuable time in this deal. I bought one at target first missing parts then I went back returned it and came back home to use it and again never worked. What a WASTE of my time! The second GARMENT STEAMER ONE and OFF button kept turning off about one minute never producing any steam. I tried to contact customer service to find out if I was using it right and customer sevice is no HELP AT ALL! MY ADVISE IS: PLEASE DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT. Sincerely,#60;br /#62;<br /> Jackeline De Ranier 
After years of trying to make smoothies in a regular blender, and having to stop and stir, and stop and stir, and worry about burning out the motor, we now don't have to worry any more. Even when ALL of the fruit we add is frozen, this machine grinds, chops, and smooths with impressive power. It's fairly easy to clean, provided you don't wait for days, and has a handy pouring valve thing. A few recipes are included 
I ended up returning this because every time I tried it with brown rice it burned the rice. I even tried doubling the recommended water amt. for brown rice and it still burned. 
I use a blender to do two things: 1) make smoothies; and 2) stir batter for crepes. This device apprently cannot handle frozen fruit. The white, plastic "teeth" on the bottom of the blades, that mesh / connect to the motor's "teeth," immediately started breaking. Three smoothies later only one plastic tooth remains and it is starting to fracture. (My smoothies were made of yogurt, O.J., some frozen mango... nothing extreme.) As far as the crepes go, even with only one "tooth" remaining, this baby still can stir eggs, milk, and a little flour (thank you for small miracles). But... the glass jug is a dribbler. When you pour batter or smoothies or whatever, some of the liquid will always (I mean always) dribble off the glass jug's lip, down the front of the jug, down the front of the control panel, and also into the recessed area where those "teeth" meet each other. So... you have to clean ALL the blender each time you use it (i.e., the jug, the control panel, the recessed area in which the jug sets) not just clean the jug. What a pain in the neck. Once the last tooth breaks, this baby is going in the garbage. 
I ordered the Pro 5 Plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times. They kept sending the "Commercial 5 mixer." In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods. I have ordered many "cookie" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer. This has been going on since the beginning of December. But no mixer! Calls end up in whatever country. All they do is placate you with polite rhetoric and pat answers. Which is their job. But this does not address the major problem. The problem is never kicked up to a higher level, researched, investigated and thus ending in a resolution. Now I see this model or its equivalent, in Costo. Very cheap but with the steel attachments (whip, dough hook etc) like the Commerical one. It looks like a combination of the Pro 5 Plus and the Commercial one. And the model no. is not listed in KitchenAde's website. There seems to be something amiss with this Pro 5 Plus model. This has been a frustrating experience. I now plan to order the Pro 6 instead, which Cook's Illustrated listed as number one. And it won't be from Amazon. Receiving the wrong one three times is a bit much. Dissapointed in the service. 
There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get 
I feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the "misguided" reviewer who likened it to a jack-hammer. That review gave me pause when I was considering ordering it. Fortunately I had faith in Amazon's return policy and decided to give it a chance. It's not at all too heavy or too large. I'm 5' 3" with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly. It really is ergonomically designed. The power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it. You have no need to change your grip until you're through blending--which is next to no time. It blends thoroughly and efficiently. It does have enough weight to give you some control. You wouldn't want something this powerful to be too light--it could just fly out of your grasp. This feels solid, is very attractive, and also appears to be very well made. I love it. If you think you might want an immersion blender (and if you cook, you do) you'll love it too. It should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender. I was confused by the two designations--hand blender/immersion blender. Apparently they are the same thing although listed separately 
The Cuisinart egg cooker: - over/under cook the eggs according to its measuring cup - plastic tray deforms after it's heated (and stays deformed) - the metal cover burns your hand - is $10 more expensive than the Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cooker, which is a much better product than Cuisinar 
This is a great thermometer, easy to use and very accurate. It is an essential tool in the kitchen for making perfect candy recipes each time. You should always test your thermometer in boiling water by reaching 212F or 100C before you use it. I like the clip that allows you to attach it to the side of the pot. It's easy to read and dishwasher proof. It's the best! 
You could almost use these incredibly practical and beautiful dishes in place of fine china. However, if you look too closely at the ivy print, you'll notice that the "ink dots" are rather large... more like a coarse newspaper photo print than the printed pictures in most magazines. If only they had printed these with higher quality.. 
Definitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards. While the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup, it's relatively thin. In a 400 degree oven, the pan actually bows. Look elsewhere for your roaster 
As advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud. I have to block my ears when it's running but I had expected that so I'm not complaining. My one complaint is that the "water tight" lid is not and if I fill it up too full liquid comes out the top. I use it for fruit smoothies (no ice) and vegetable soups and they come out very smooth 
I've had my Keurig for about two months now and absolutely love it. It makes wonderful tasting coffee in 30 seconds or so. It was well worth the extra money 
Since I liked it so much, I decided to purchase a second one the day the first one arrived. Was very disappointed to see that the price has gone up $10 in just one week! However, the quality is good and I am satisfied with the item 
Received the bowls yesterday, and once again very upset to find 3 of the 4 broken. This has got to be costing a ton of money in refunds and shipping. I will not try again for a replacement, I didn't do well with the Sango mixing bowls either. Can't understand why these are shipped with such little packing material 
That's right. I got taken twice. I bought this cooker for under $20 a few years ago, and it died after the second use. Considering it was so inexpensive, I just bought another one. It died again after only one use. I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand because it seems to be a common problem. I guess Salton just recycle their returns so they can afford to pay George Foreman the $90 million they owe him for endorsements 
I just moved into my new place and I wanted a new set of dishes that were simple but unique and this set was perfect. Just like past reviews have stated, these pieces are a perfect size. The bowls are awesome cereal bowls, the dinner plates are large, the salad plates are perfect for salad or a sandwich w/ chips and the coffee cups are used every morning for my cup of joe. I bought a second set to make sure I had plenty for when friends came over for dinner. Speaking of friends over for dinner, on the two occasions that I have had friends over for dinner since I bought the set, people always compliment the pieces. I am very happy with my purchase 
I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan (set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan 
I do not think any human being can fall asleep on this trash. Actually i can not even lie on this for more than 1 minute and I feel low back pain. it has good material but poor design. 
I have owned this breadman for one year. I make between one and two loafs of bread per week. Mostly whole wheat bread. I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years). Pros: It makes a good loaf of bread. Good selection of cycles. Loaf is easy to extract from the pan. Cons: The motor is not very powerful. It lugs down when making whole wheat bread. After 7 months of operation the Teflon wore off the mixing paddle. At 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan. Overall I am disappointed in this bread machine and I could not recommend it 
This item was broken when it was received. It was not packed properly 
I bought this grinder for flax seed and it works wonderfully. What I love most is that after you grind what you need you can place the tight sealing lid that comes with it on and put in right into the fridge. Nice look, great function and very clean machine. 
Great product. I am using this because my kitchen is under remodelling. Works great with smaller vessels. Heats up evenly. I give 4 points because I am annoyed by the bulb on the stove. It is ON as long as the burner is connected to power. I would rather have a burner which has bulb to show if the burner is ON/OFF. 
This Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen. I purchased it pre-seasoned because I've never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware. Bottom line: While the pre-seasoning was a plus, it's not necessary. Just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the Lodge cookware, and you'll be fine. My family has had cast iron for generations, and I won't pay the exhorbitant prices for those "upscale, professional" dutch ovens that are all the rage these days. This Lodge oven browns spectacularly, and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one, that's not a problem if one simply uses one's nose. We can all tell when enough is enough... I particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which aren't present on the more expensive ones. These spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and I don't have to worry about a dry product. The lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which I own, and that's a plus. It conducts heat well and when I use it camping as an oven, breads and biscuits come out as well as at home. Yes, it's heavy, but that's the nature of cast iron, no?? If you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this Lodge piece, be prepared to shell out big bucks 
I cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210. While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors (not carpet), now after only 4 months of light use (we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home), the unit is trashed. The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was "probably trashed". She was right. If you want to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you'll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether 
I am sorry to say that I was not satisfied with this pan at all! The cakes I bake are browning, even burning on the edges BEFORE the middle is even done! The edges are rising but the middle is slumping down. I own the Calphalon cookware and that is nice but they have a STINKER in their bakeware. My recommendation= Look at a different pan 
I loved this coffeemaker, until it just suddenly stopped working and it isn't even 1 year old!! Previous coffeemakers I owned have lasted years and years. I expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over $[...]+. Now I have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle. I am NOT a happy customer 
We have owned this blender for about 3 years. If I had to do it again I definitely would not buy this blender. First, it is very loud. The timer quit working and the band rivets around the jar are rusty. The only things I like about it are that it is easy to clean and the jar is nice and big. Other than that don't waste your time 
I have owned this can opener now for several months and it is BY FAR the BEST can opener I have ever owned. I have had probably 10 electric openers in my lifetime, but this is just wonderful. It is smooth, super easy to attach the can, quiet, and does NOT splatter the contents of the can all over the opener when it's done cutting like all the other did!!! The detachable parts make it sanitary too, you can put it in the dishwasher! I can't say enough about this opener....you will NOT be disappointed!! 
This thermometer never worked correctly. For oven temps. over 350 the probe is worthless, it reads the oven temp., not the temp. of the meat. Save your money and buy and old fashoined one 
This toaster is definetly well worth the price. It is sturdy, compact and full of features. And the best of all! It doesn't burn the toast! Very happy with it and the $10.00 less price than at Macy's! 
We looked in all the local brick and mortar stores for a quality holder with no luck. Even though we were skeptical ordering online, this product far exceeded our expectations. Do not hesitate, it is well worth the asking price 
This plate, the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate, just so you know. It's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes. My aunt has had the Winter Frost White as long as I can remember, and now I am slowly building my own collection. I love them - they are very light and strong. I tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact. The material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds. They are so thin and light that I could probably carry at least 35 of them. This is perfect for your everyday meals. Highly recommended 
We were more than pleased with our purchase of this item, and it arrived sooner than expected. It was very very nice and well worth the great discounted price we received it for. 
A very solid knife set, especially with the extra slots for those who have a few "favorite" knifes left in the drawer. MAKE SURE when you buy Henckels to get the "twin" set instead of the single little henckel-man, that's a big upgrade in quality. Oh, and for goodness sake people, quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go 
Like the other reviewers, I followed the instructions for this machine to the letter. I froze the canister in my deep-freeze for several days and took it out just in time to load it. Although the recipe provided was quite tasty, even after 60 minutes the stuff never even got cold enough to reach the slush stage, let alone ice cream. My kids pretty much drank it from the bowl. It's advertised to make ice cream in 20 minutes; no way. Returned it the next day (and paid for shipping) 
These sheets are like 200 cotton count not 1200 cotton count. Do not order you will be sorry!! 
Very, very, disappointed and irritated. HUMBUG, I ordered this rice cooker and I just received it today. I really wish, I had read some of the reviews above. The description on this site clearly states that the rice cooker stays warm for 5 hours! The manual clearly states it does NOT. I bought it because of the keep warm for 5 hours promise. I can get a CHEAP, basic cook and shut off at Wal-Mart for $12 here in Georgia. I'll be sending it back tomorrow, and I'm very upset that I have to take the time to do it, HUMBUG!~ I like Amazon .com, but I'm really mad about this. No Christmas rice for me 
For those of you that enjoy cooking and the best for your kitchen, these dutch ovens are a must! Excellent for slow cooked stews, roasts and soups. Wonderful heat retention with the cast iron core and the enamel coating keeps it a snap to clean. No sticking and no taste or metal reactions plus the colors are so attractive, they can be a really nice accent in your kitchen. 
I have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch, but sometimes I sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff. I probably use these every other batch or so now. When I first started making yogurt, using these packets allowed me to vary the time and/or add powdered milk until I found my perfect batch! I don't add powdered milk - it makes it thicker but more tart and I prefer it a bit thinner after getting addicted to it in Europe last year. This is the perfect tool for newbies - and a cupboard staple for the more seasoned yogurt-heads 
I bought this item and had it delivered about a month and a half ago. It arrived in perfect condition with all the items it says it will come with. It's very easy to use and extremely easy to clean. So far I have only cooked whole chickens, chicken pieces, shishkabobs, and sausages. If I only ever used it to just cook chicken, it's still a great price. If you can follow simple instructions, you can't go wrong with this 
This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing 
After my Ronco machine broke, I bought this one. It never worked well for hollow pasta, and the bearings went out after about 20 uses 
I love these dishes. They are lead-free and you can do so much with them because they are a solid color. I liked the sea mist color even more when I saw the actual dishes--it is very soothing to the eye, and I don't think that I will get tired of it as I might with one of the brighter or darker colors. 
I am simply amazed that anyone can be satisfied with this pan. I bought this pan last week. I fried bacon it on medium heat (as advised by salesperson). Bacon stuck. Fried eggs on medium heat. Eggs stuck. Ok, must be my fault--try low heat. I fried bacon on low heat. Bacon stuck. Fried eggs on low heat. Eggs stuck. Pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap (as the instructions advise). I promptly returned the pan and got a non-stick. My life is much better. Do NOT be fooled by the pan's good looks. Think its just me? My wife's sister bought the same pan. Her report: everything sticks. My sister has the pan. She hates it! Guess what? Everything sticks. How can a product be so popular and perform so aweful? You are hereby on notice. 
I loved this iron until it died after owning it for a little over a year. I bought this iron because Consumer Reports rated it #1. It was a great iron while it worked. (I iron about once a week - sometimes twice a month.) I've had irons last for years and I usually get rid of them because they lack the bells and whistles not because they fail to work. Black Decker Customer Service acted like I was the only one whoever had a problem with one of their products and told me to go buy another iron because it was over a year old. I'm sorry, but I think with light use, an iron should last more than a year. Forget Black Decker. I'm trying Rowenta or Bosch 
... I returned it without even using it because it did not feel like a quaility item. I would not recomend this product if you have any taste 
I bought 2 sets expecting them to be as good as the other Corning products I have used for over 30 years. 1 piece cracked in half while cooking vegetable in the microwave and one piece cracked in half while baking chicken in the oven! I wrote to the company and they have not responded 
This is a complete waste of time. This thing takes a lot longer than a traditional knife. The tomato juice goes everywhere and its flimsy. You actually have to saw and the blades bend like crazy. Dont waste your time or money 
Arrived defective,right out of the box. Will not oscillate; something inside is obviously amiss.So why even bother with it 
Looks great in my kitchen but I, too, only use it for shakes smoothies. It DOES smell like burning rubber nearly every time. I used to think something was wrong with it and now I just disregard it. And after less than two years or making smoothies, I'm replacing the blade gasket assembly. 
I had received this set for my Birthday from a friend. When we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 Quart pot was scratched on the interior. This made the non-stick aspect of the pot worthless. I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out. When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot. I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say. I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up. In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non-stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily. If you get the Calphalon One Infused-Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service. Remember the old saying "you get what you pay for." I don't think these non-stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use. If you do choose to buy these pans examine them when you open the box for damage 
YOU ARE BETTER ROLLING YOUR WINDOWS DOWN! THIS THING DOES NOT WORK. I HAVE A SHARPER IMAGE ONE THAT IS ALOT BETTER. THIS ONE IS A GENERIC IMITATION THAT DOES NOT CLEAN THE AIR. CRAP!!!!! 
This is the second one of these I've purchased (the first was a Thermos branded one without the cover). It keeps my can of soda, etc cold throughout and adds a touch of class to keeping it on my desk. Both of these are VERY rugged and I would highly recommend over a standard foam cooler. Absolutely the most functional, effective, and classy cooler I've ever had! 
Don't waste your money. I bought this because it was small and I wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones. It burns the rice every time no matter how much I adjust the water ratio. And brown rice - forget it, even more burned on the bottom. You have to watch it instead of being able to rely on it doing what it says it will do. It has yet to turn out 'perfect rice.' If I could rate this a zero I would 
I did not find a problem with the balance, as previously mentioned by another reviewer. The only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is, that if they are planning on tossing their food, they had better be strong because this unit is heavy! Other than that, it proves to be very useful for large portions. It heats quickly, heats evenly, holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir. Yes, it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides. The purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well. Now keep in mind, there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top, flat top or coil range. True frying ala Asian style is done on an open flame! 
This is my third Rowenta iron and they have all served me well, but this is by far the best. The steam is amazing. You only have to made one pass on most items. I know it is a lot of money for an iron but it is worth every penny for the time it saves 
I bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly. I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange. I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called, I was told I was supposed to send in $14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it. The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer. It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans. I just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in, including the oven but I doubt I will reorder this product. Too unpredictible. 
This item turned to rust after the first use. I do not recommend this product 
I have to say, I have been needing a meat pounder for a long time and this one is great. I used it on chicken and it did a great job with very little effort on my part. Plus is was very easy to clean, just some soap and water. I am very pleased with this item 
At first we loved this pan. We've used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven. I've contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan. I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment 
I wish I'd read the previous reviews! I ordered this for $14.99 as a bottom of the page special and it's going back. It is not two inches thick as described, but 3/4. What a disappointment! And now I see that the regular price has been changed from $25 to $40. YIKES! Don't bother.. 
I wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is so convenient. Easy to clean up. Very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking. Seems powerful enough for everything I have tried it on. You still need to pull out the big food processor for larger amounts because this only holds 1 cup or so. That would be the only negative. Otherwise I love it. Great product for the price. $14 well spent!! 
I find this timer very easy to use. I'm not a rocket scientist. I have never been disappointed with Kitchen Aid. I don't understand why it has gotten bad reviews. I think some people should stick with a sun dial 
This knife is well worth the money. It is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables, fruit you name it. Honestly, I felt it was too much for me but as I got better accustomed to its heft, I knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool. Do not doubt yourself, learning to use it is a joy. Treat yourself 
I have never owned a crock pot before, so I was a little apprehensive. I did a lot of research and finally settled on this item because of size, price and shape of the unit. I am extremely happy with the product. It is perferct for a first time user - not too complicated, but has eveything you need to make the most basic or more complicated recepies. It did not smell at all on first use (many pots have that reputation). It is very attractive and fits nicely on my countertop. The inner ceremic part is very sturdy and cleans up very easily. I do recommend for first-time users that you purchase one good cookbook (many are carried on Amazon). I purchased several, and my favorite so far is "The Gormet Slow Cooker" I have tried several recepies and they were all perfect. I am converted to crock-pot cooking!! 
If you are looking for a nice, inexpensive set of knives, look no further. This set is very sharp, cuts well and fits into your hand nicely. They have great balance and apperance. The box is a little cheap feeling and looking, but allows for a great storage within a drawer or cabinet. 
After one wash cycle, these sheets split at the seams. Otherwise soft and comfortable 
No postives to report. The unit is: 1.Too small to make enough cheese to bother with. 2 Very difficult to clean. 3 Poorly designed; the cheese sits in the whey. 4.Overpriced. This should retail for under eight bucks. Four or five on sale. Faster and easier to use cheese cloth than this device. 
it's just bad looking plastic. if you want expresso buy nespresso machine with capsules 
I've been using a large Cusinart for over 10 years. It is marvelous, so I decided to get the mini-mate chopper for smaller jobs. WRONG IDEA!! This is a horrible little machine. It won't grind more than a couple of seeds at a time forget chopping! The grinding unit won't rotate most of the time. It's going to the Salvation Army as a donation. 
Discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use. As a smoothie addict, shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily, I'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance (is a full year's use asking too much?). The Braun burned out in the first 90 days, faster than my Black and Decker, Oster, even Hamilton Beach (though it lasted longer than Back to the Basics). The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it doesn't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons (always look for a single switch, a knob, or a touch-pad). Otherwise, their shavers have served me better, mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes. I'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic single-switch Oster another try, though I'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars 
Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports. It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning. I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work. If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports 
I have to admit that I was surprised when the rolling pin arrived. I'm used to OXO quality, but this is over the top. It is a big rolling pin, with an ideal diameter. It is also heavy. It's heft helps keep it where it belongs, instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder. It has a strong axle, which glides remarkably smoothly, even when the pressure is on. The hard non stick surface works very well, and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings. The handles are simply the best I have have encountered. This is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the Good Grips promise of quality 
This is a really nice cookie sheet. I baked cookies soon after I received this cookie sheet, and they were great! I plan to order another so that I have 2 on hand. I am tired of the nonstick pans that scratch and then rust easily. This is a nice alternative 
When I was searching for something to simplify my life I came upon this product. I thought I would give it a try as I love egg mcmuffins. It is everything I dreamed of and more. Easy, convient, done in less than five minutes and a breeze to clean up. I love it and can't stop telling family and friends about it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have 
I had been looking for egg rings (without knowing what such a thing was actually called) for a long time before I happened upon these babies. As soon as I saw them I knew they were exactly what I had been looking for and ordered them on the spot. Unfortunately, my glee turned sour when I tried to use my new egg rings. A lot of people report they haven't had a problem with sticking, but that is not consistant with my experience. Eggs stick to virtually everything, and these rings are no exception. Trying to remove the ring and flip the egg is a pain, usually I flip the ring and the egg flips with it, and then I have to cut the egg away from the ring so it falls down to the pan 
I am a man who loves his tea. I drink up to a dozen cups a day, so I use my tea ball quite frequently. My major complaint with most tea balls, and the reason I must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely. Over time this gets worse, and the tea ball becomes unusable. There are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy. I just got this tea ball in the mail a week ago, and while it is still usable, the clip is already losing its grip. Look somewhere else for a tea ball. 
Great price for beautiful, high-quality sheets that get softer with every wash. Fabulous color! Sheets fit well over a mattress with pillow-top. Recommend 100%. 
Great for frying eggs, but I prefer a pan with higher sides for omlets. Every grilled sandwich I've made on this griddle has come out perfect. My kids use it to make pancakes and they swear by it. I've found that pre-heating the griddle in the oven first helps it heat more evenly and avoid the hot spots that can occur when cooking on a stove top. The pre-seasoning works great 
I agree with the previous reviewers. The style is quite sleek and the ceramic, earthen material eliminates the metallic taste of the water. However, the handle is a huge problem and you have to be extremely careful when pouring the pot. I made a hot of tea only filling 1/2 way full and put pouring it the handle can apart from the kettle and smash went the kettle, leaving me standing with only the handle in my hand. Thankfully I was pouring this over the sink or I would've suffered quite a burn. Buyer beware 
Not sure how other people have been able to make a real loaf of bread with this, but I certainly could not. I made three attempts, all failures for various reasons. Either it did not mix, or the dough was so hard it knocked the pan off its base, or it created pebbles of dough. It definitely can not be left unattended, which defeats the purpose of delay start. It bakes OK though, but you better do all the upfront work yourself. PS. I was using the recipes that come with the maker 
If you prefer having bread that is toasted on both sides look elsewhere for a toaster. Even when it is not on the bagel "setting" it does not do any more than barely warm one side of bread. In addition if you are looking for a blue toaster (how I wound up with this one despite the warnings about its inefficiency) don't buy this one--it looks nothing like the picture on the internet. It is purple, so not only does it perform poorly it looks terrible in my blue/gray kitchen. I expected more from a KitchenAid product and if I could return a used toaster (albeit only 3 times) I certainly would. 
Excellent product for the value. I was hesitant to purchase china via internet or mail, but the china arrived in perfect condition, and is beautiful and timeless. Thank you. 
I used one of these when I was a teenager working in a pizza joint to scrape dough balls off the pan so I could spin pizza's. Until recently I never knew how versitile these things are. I use it constantly to keep my cutting board clean, scape rememants of one item off before chopping the next, I use the side to smash garlic cloves, use the rounded handle to smooth surfaces, and more. This thing is versatile, not just for baking. For the cheap price of this thing, no kitchen should be without 
We lived in Asia for five years and we eat a lot of rice. In Asia we owned a very cheap rice cooker that worked perfectly well (but different voltage). When we returned to the USA, I purchased the cuisinart 8-cup rice cooker (CRC-800) thinking I was getting "top of the line." It made such an enormous mess every time we used it, so I called cuisnart to find out if somehow (despite meticulous reading of the instructions) we were doing something wrong. No, it seemed we were doing everything correctly. So we tried a few more times, and then in exasperation returned the rice cooker for a new one. We thought given the generally good quality of cuisinart appliances, this one must be defective. Well the new one does the same thing! I give up. Enough of the messes. I got so frustrated I sent cuisinart a picture. C'mon this is not high-tech stuff! Get it right or take it off the market 
Contrary to the description above, this is NOT a non-stick pan. I tried making eggs and pancakes on the pan. Everything stuck to the bottom. I used bacon grease on the pan before I made the eggs. They stuck. I used butter on the pan before I made the pancakes. They stuck. I could not get the pancakes off the bottom of the pan without destroying them. This might be a good pan for searing and the cleanup that comes with it, but it is definitely NOT a pan to make breakfast or any other meal that requires a non-stick pan. My 12-year-old T-Fal with a worn surface outperformed this pan making pancakes. I am definitely returning it 
We were so looking forward to fresh lemondade. The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box, pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing. On the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon. We were all very disappoined, my 5 kids and I : ( I had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others. 
I absolutely LOVE this cookware. Don't be put off by the seemingly high price. You will hand this stuff down to your kids. What's so special about it? It out performs all of my other cookware (yes, even All-Clad) on the stovetop and in the oven. The even heating is better than I could have imagined. It will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops. And, as an added bonus, it's the easiest to clean. I use mine for most everything . . . pot roast, soup, stew, pasta sauces, braising, slow-cooking, etc. It's great 
Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated. Nice furniture and practical book shelves. But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around. It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying. But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water. 
this set of blender accessories was just what i needed to update my old blender. seperatly these items become more costly but here they are at a great value and shopping is made easy because this set has it all 
We celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years. The Cuisinart TOB-50 is number 4. It's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I'm optimistist. We choose it for it's simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it's early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I've seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don't want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It is a nice size without being too bulky. We store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor. It will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size. It has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done. The crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean. The only "con" I can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely 
I'm surprised you requested this review because I returned the item. They were just what I wanted, color and all, but when I tried to put the dinner plates in the dishwasher they only fit if I placed them using two spaces. This reduced the dishwasher capacity. Next problem surfaced when the same dinner dishes didn't fit in my standard sized kitchen cabinet 
This takes a little practice to get used to putting the opener properly on the can. However, once you do, it works extremely well- it turns smoothly and cans are opened cleanly, regardless of can size. I especially like having no sharp edges 
Ok...so this isnt a review,but a question I have on this product. Where is the instruction manual to this thing? What do the lines above the alcohol names mean. There are two, three, even four lines above some of the alcohol names. Does it mean the amount of alcohol that is supposed to be put into that particular drink. Please answer...for it has left many of us flustered. thank you very muc 
I also tried some cotton Wamsutta sheets from Bed Bath, and Beyond and they pilled the first time I washed them. I was able to return them to the store, but it was a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend these sheets or any Wamsutta sheets because I think they're poor quality 
The FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil. The big problem with this unit is the motor/gear train that drives the slicing wheel. The drive gear is plastic and will not tolerate any kind of continuous load and will strip out fairly easily if pushed too hard. We smoked the motor and stripped the gears just slicing up a couple of small roasts and we were not working the unit that hard. It does a decent job for the person that just wants to slice up a small bunch of deli foods for a party or do a weeks worth of cheese for the kids lunches but honestly a good knife will do just as well and not set you back ten minutes for cleaning every time you use it. If you are looking for a slicer to do more serious work you will have to spend the money and get something in the $400+ range. What this slicer is good for the deli counter can do for you for free when you buy your bologna. 
This is warm, beautiful, soft and a fabulous bargain! I highly recommend it... and buy the matching sheets! They're a wonderful combination 
If you have problems with gripping those round coffee grinders, this one is for you! It's oval shape makes holding it much easier than a round grinder. It grinds well and quickly and is a breeze to clean with just a few flicks of a pastry brush (dedicate one specially for this as it will discolor over time). It's the shape that makes it great 
This is a brilliant device and the Daddy of pizza wheels, all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune! One spin across the pizza and it's done! no repeated to and froing or worse, finishing the job with a knife! It does not need sharpening either, just as well cos I am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job! Oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now 
I purchased this mug for my wife as a Christmas gift. She just loves it. She useds almost everyday. It has been 4 months now and as good as new. 
I bought this coffee pot after owning the older version of the grind and brew. Silly of me to think this would be an improvement. The front load basket design is terrible. It is a true "pain" to clean this section, you cannot get your hands or any tool I have in my kitchen to clean the mechanisms. Therefore, the brew basket sticks and at times the latch that holds the basket in will at times be gummed up. Then when you start to brew your coffee thinking that the latch is closed, its not - its gummed up. Not a problem until the heat and moisture from the brewing coffee loosen the gunk up and your basket shoots out and the coffee brews all over your counter. As many times as hubby and I try to clean this its become too much of a pain, this coffee pot is out of here... and on its way to the curb. I actually am contemplating sending it back to cuisinart in pieces!!!!!! Poor design. Did I mention the coffee itself does not seem to have the same flavor as the other machine. I think this one brews at a higher temp making the coffee bitter. My advise as a seasoned coffee maker/drinker. PASS save your money and your headaches 
Purchased the toaster as a gift for my daughter's family. They LOVE it. With 2 kids and friends, the large capacity, sleek design, and perfect toasted bagels, keeps everyone happy. Get lots of positive comments from friends on how it looks and toasts! 
Product not even worth a penny. Impossible to use after the first wash..Wont recommend to anyon 
Love the functionality - being able to separate for different uses esp. meat and that they flex to enable direct frop into the pan. But mine came off color (sorta transparent) at the corners (and this wasn't a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets) but still good value - not worth exchanging so I kept them. I guess mine look unique 
I also tried some cotton Wamsutta sheets from Bed Bath, and Beyond and they pilled the first time I washed them. I was able to return them to the store, but it was a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend these sheets or any Wamsutta sheets because I think they're poor quality 
My Mom bought me this set for my anniversary two years ago. We use it regularly and run it through the dishwasher and it is just horrible looking. It spots and marks pitifully. I can't get most of the spots off no matter what I do. I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in, but with the weight of the set (because it really is a heavy-duty set of flatware) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time. So, I am just putting my experience out there to help others make an informed decision 
I haven't had a chance to use them yet as the holidays are just approaching, but they look good and sturdy. If the cheesecakes come out well, I'll know then, but so far, so good. They delivered on time too. 
My first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings. I have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven. The statement on the inside instructions "WHEN COOKING IN A BARBECUE OR SMOKER, DO NOT USE AS A CONTINUOUS READ THERMOMETER, USE ONLY AS AN INSTANT READ THERMOMETER.", "5. DO NOT USE THIS UNIT TO MEASURE COOKING TEMPERATURES OVER 392◦F." as well as "WARRANTY EXCLUDES THERMOMETER PROBES." should be on the outside, letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk. If you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours, a cheap $6.00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat. Why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86◦ to 572◦ if you can only use to 392◦. I would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit's instructions, but 275◦ in the oven killed mine so maybe not? Cut to the chase, look for a better unit and let me know when you find it 
Pretty good product. We have not changed the batteries yet it does get quite a bit of usage. It's easy to use not an eye-sore in my kitchen. Very fast shipping! I would order again 
We liked the idea that the caraffe didn't need to be heated from below... a big plus with this unit. But.... we have had some serious problems with the filter backing up and the water leaking over the top of it everywhere on the counter. A FLOOD of coffee. We thought that it might be the filter holes were clogged... so we made sure they were rinsed out well and could easily flow a stream through them. But then we had a flood again on the counter. So we thought that maybe our filters were'nt good... so we bought other ones. And them we had another big flood of coffee (this has proven to be very staining to our white grouting). So we thought perhaps we were grinding our coffee too fine and it was packing down too tight.... so we ground it coarser... and yet, ANOTHER DANG FLOOD. We have followed the instructions perfectly... and still these overflows. So now we are ticked... we have never had this headache with a coffee maker before.... and all we want is some coffee in the morning. So we're going to try and return the stupid thing (our reciept and box are long gone). Sure hope we can get an exchange... and certainly NOT another one of these. Oh... and the mugs that come with it don't have handles on them like the ones in the picture do 
I LOVE THIS PITCHER IT SITS ON MY COUNTER ALL THE TIME.BEATIFUL COBALT BLUE COLOR,WITH WHITE INSIDE,REALLY ADDS SOMETHING TO CREAMERS,WISH ... SOLD THE BIG ONE I WOULD BUY IT IN A HEART BEAT.GREAT FOR SYRUP ALSO 
This Cloth Cover is great and made from a very good material, but it doesn't quite fit the 6 quart KitchenAid mixer it is a few inches short 
We have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it. We now have to borrow a friends Hoover Steamvac when we need to clean the carpet. We are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right. It never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection. I wouldn't buy 
I purchased this knife, and when it arrived, the package said, "Not recommended for left-handers." If Henckels chooses to design only for right-handed people, that's their right, but they should disclose it clearly. Second, [Amazon.com] should include such information in their editorial review. I'm left-handed, and I'll add this to my can opener and vegetable peeler as one-way kitchen gadgets 
I have a Kitchenaid model K5SSWH Heavy Duty Mixer and they do not fit over my 5 qt bowl. I regrettably only read the editorial review and bought these covers thinking I can snap them on. I use them to loosely cover my attachments now, but I could have used anything for that 
This cooker makes the best jasmine rice if you measure 1 1/2 cups raw, jasmine rice into the cooker, wash it under cold water for 3 washings, and then fill the cooker with water up just under the 2 cup mark (more like 1 1/2 cups water) with the washed rice still in the cooker. Just push the button and taste GREAT, FLUFFY rice - EVERYTIME in only 20 minutes or less! I love my cooker and have sent these as gifts to my children and friends. Maybell 
This (Rose Fiestaware) sugar and creamer set is very beautiful - true to all of the fiestaware pieces. This set goes very nicely with the large fiestaware teapot -- a wonderful gift for anyone and durable, pretty and cheerful to use for your own family. The availability was great and the speed of delivery was wonderful -- Amazon does an outstanding job as usual of customer service! All of the Amazon staff are polite, helpful, and efficient. 
I bought two sets to take advantage of the free shipping, despite the low reviews. (I plan to buy good sheets once they go on clearance at the end of the season...) When I took one set out of the package there was already a hole in it. Amazon replaced them, but when I washed them they feel like they are going to fall apart. The filled up the lint collector. I have red and green lint everywhere, even after washing them. You get what you pay for 
We have had ours less than one year and we hate it for all the reasons everyone else have listed. It doesn't toast evenly etc. Don't buy it 
The pot rack came as advertised and it was a snap to put up. It looks OK and works well with my wall space. I would purchase this item again 
We needed to replace a 30 year old Farberware frypan. This pan was better than we expected. We are so grateful for Amazon.com!! 
I've had this yogurt maker for about six months now and have been very pleased with the results. I heat up the milk in my microwave (recording the times in my owner's manual so I always know just what to do) and my total hands-on time is only about five minutes from start to finish. To those who are disappointed that your yogurt may not be as thick as commercial yogurt, please remember that most brands add gelatin as a thickener, so naturally your yogurt wouldn't be that thick 
Although Consumer Reports rated this model as #2, I have found this a very disappointing purchase. The cheap aluminum parts inside bend all the time jamming the toaster. It toasts very uneavenly and inconsistently. I am very sorry I purchased this toaster. I was expecting much more from a toaster so highly rated but I've learned that Consumer Reports does not always get everything right. Listen to the other warnings and stay away from this toaster. As soon as I find another toaster, this one goes off to Goodwill. 
I am surprised to see so many negative reviews. We've had ours for five or six years, use it at least daily, and have been quite satisified with its performance. It generally toasts the bread evenly, and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next. It doesn't seem that slow to me, but my expectations may differ from yours. I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the four-slice setting. I also agree it is a bit pricey, but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently. Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem, but we wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. Good luck 
the product is an average product, do not think it is a top seller, another retailer has the same item cheaper.. the delivery and customer service is the wrost I have ever experienced.... would not order this item again with the poor delivery. 
This is the perfect size food processor and blender for the home cook. I like to use it to make homemade basil pesto, hummus, smoothies and shakes. Its pretty powerful, good quality for the price, and doesn't take up too much space in the kitchen 
I've had 2 Polder Thermometers and both of them have had a VERY short life span. Don't waste your money 
Although it's a 'chicken fryer', I use it to pan-fry everything, and it works amazing! The depth of the pan allows larger amount of food inside, being stirred without spilling out. And the smaller diameter helps to concentrate heat in the pan. The nonstick feature truly works, nothing sticks to the pan, even the thick starch 
Looks good Works even better Nice storage case for attachment 
This is a great roasting pan and is heavy and solid in the way all All Clad pans are. But it is huge. If you frequently roast 20 lb turkeys or half an ox, this pan is for you. A regular roasting chicken looks pretty small and forlorn. It is a terrifically well-made roaster, but I find I also need one just a bit smaller 
These knives barely cut.... and the title is misleading. This set has nothing to do with Faberware. Also, I have had this set for only a few weeks and already rust has appearred on them. Buy them if you intend it for one time use 
After your pan starts sticking, you go to their web site to complain and you find .... A warning that you can't use high heat on this pan. They warn you if you use high heat or some sprays, the pan will then start to stick. Yes, you've just been ..... and you paid $40 for the privilege. Imagine, a frying pan that doesn't like heat. How much heat? They don't tell you. If your pan is sticking, then it must have been toooo much. Buy at your own risk 
My boyfriend and I live in a two room apartment. There is not a lot of storage space. I ordered two of these hampers and the first one just came. I put his clothes in and he still has half of the hamper left. I am so glad to get something that is sturdy and large now we will have a place to put our clothes. 
I bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive. I placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use, and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done. I then checked Amazon's reviews, and found that this was a common experience. They're going back to the store tomorrow. 
I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price. I expected it to get me through that winter only. I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years, heat in fall/winter and fan in summer. It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter. The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose. Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated. The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately. I'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough. I just bought two more, my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails. A good, solid product for a very good price 
A well made no frills percolator. It packs well,is quite simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee. The ideal coffee pot for camping or outdoor use. A superior product compared to the many flimsy coffee pots made for campers 
Perhaps like you, I love silicone. You can do anything with silicone. You can fry, poach, make soups, and there is never a worry about heat. Le Crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils, but their wood is unfinished, so unless you keep them oiled, they will age and spilter. These you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated, and are water resistant. In addition to these being made for the long hall, their shape is unique. I like that the shape is slightly angled, this makes it easier to run along the edges of a bowl. I have been so happy with my purchase of these! I can't say enough good things about them. I would recommend these over other manufactors, they are better made, and improve in others weaker areas. A must have for your kitchen 
There are all kinds of similar products that claim to be heat resistant to this or that temp. All I can say is these Spatulas are the real deal when it comes to heat resistance and at a great price. I only wish there were a 3rd somewhat smaller blade. However, you can't go wrong with these first two sizes. 
This is an outstanding device. in several I've had before the cutter blades were not fastened to the center piece. They would flex as the coring progressed and the slices would be rendered a mess. This corer has rigidly attached blades and therefore cuts clean, perfect slices every time 
I totally love this pan! I bake cakes all the time using this and other Hoffritz pans and they are absolutely wonderful. I was first impressed by the weight of the pan, the non-stick sufrace, and the even heat distribution. I noticed a remarkable difference in the quality of my cakes from the very first time I used the pan. Not only do my cakes look and taste great, I never have to worry about my cakes getting stuck to the pan or being lopsided. I'll never buy a cheap pan again. It's really is worth the extra couple of dollars. I doubt I'll ever have to replace any of the pans I've bought from them. I also purchased the Hoffritz springform pans and 9" rounds, same great results 
I, too, own several KitchenAid products and have been delighted with previous products. When I needed a new coffee maker, I decided to switch brands to KitchenAid based on prior history with the company. HOWEVER, this is the WORST coffee maker I've ever owned, including cheaper models. I'm now on my second coffee pot after KitchenAid sent me a new one when the one I ordered failed. While the company has been more than understanding, I hesitate to call again because I don't even want another one. Getting my money back shouldn't lie with the hands of the seller I purchased it from. Here's the problem. After a week of use, the water and grounds kept spilling over and coffee was not draining into the pot, saturating the electric plate and my kitchen floor. When I could get it just right (standing there holding the carafe in place), the coffee tasted burnt. I thought I had a defective product, but the new one is starting to do the same thing. The carafe does not stay in place and slides forward when placed on the electric plate (until there is enough coffee dispensed. The coffee carafe is supposed to push (when it's in the right place) on the plastic piece that releases the coffee. It's a design problem. It's definitely cheaply made. I have to stand next to my coffee maker as it's brewing to make sure the coffee is dripping. Believe me, I wouldn't have bothered writing this if I didn't think it might save someone else the headaches. Buy something else! It's not worth the hassle. 
Cuisinart is one manufacturer that has capitalized on its brand name and produced this inferior product. My criticisms of this machine: 1. Its heavy and relatively large. It is awkward to place in and remove from a cabinet, and so it remains on the counter top where it takes up precious real estate with its large footprint. 2. It's slow. With its weight, you would think the grinder would have a powerful motor that would quickly grind coffee. It does not. It takes a very long time to grind the coffee. 3. The grind is uneven and actually clumps. The grind is fine at the bottom and course and clumpy at the top. The finely ground coffee sticks to the bottom of the bowl below the blade. I must use a finger to remove the ground coffee or pound the bowel against the palm of my other hand. Pulsing makes no difference. Grinding a full bowl improves the performance somewhat. Yet, grinding beans for up to minute still does not produce a grind fine enough for even a cone filter. Espresso is out of the question. 4. I invariably spill ground coffee on the counter top no matter how carefully I remove the lid. Although the grinder looks cool with its stainless steel finish and it has a larger bowl than most blade grinders, those two alone do not even come close to overcoming its other deficiencies. Surely there must be better blade coffee grinders on the market 
I've never had trouble fitting my butter stick in the Fiestaware butter dish. Never. But the reviewer sho couldn't get hers to fit did give me a chuckle 
I did a lot of research before purchasing a grinder and I'm glad I took the time to narrow it down to this one. It has done a great job at a consistant grind, with minimal noise, and tons of grind settings. Quality 
Be careful to buy products from compact appliance. They will not be responsible if the product is defective from the manufacturer. There is no return. You better think more than twice before you buy from compact appliance. They have the worst customer service including the manufacturer Edgestar. I agreed completely with the previous customer review that it is hard to get in touch with Edgestar customer service, which has the worst product I ever bought. 
So cliche...but I am forced to learn this lesson OVER OVER. I thought to myself $100 for a rice cooker, and bought a $20 one in Chinatown. It gave me nothing but trouble...Soggy rice, sometimes burned at the bottom, et cetera... With a friend's suggestion, I made the switch...I decided to invest in this Zojirushi rice cooker and it has been coming out right everytime. You won't be disappointed 
I love my Donvier! I got it as a gift a number of years ago and won't let it out of my kitchen. Just last night, I made an impromtu batch of ice cream for a guest, using some over-ripe strawberries in the refrigerator. But once we got started we also added a banana and some pecans, first blended in the blender. The end result was scrumptuous. Ice Cream making can be SOOOO easy with this little gadget. My grandchildren love for me to get it out. What a tasty treat! Who doesn't love home-made ice cream, especially when you can see it being made, or better still, help make it. Keep the inner core in your freezer and the lightweight plastic outer container in a bottom cabinet. No mess, no fuss, no problem. If you like ice cream and want a simple way of making it, this Donvier is the answer. Buy one. No, buy two and give one away. If I had not gotten mine as a gift, I might never have known the pleasure. Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'. 
My fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us. I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware. This is exactly what the Dr. ordered! Here's why: 1) Heavy, sturdy construction. These things can take a beating. They heat evenly and hold heat very well. 2) You can use metal utensils with them. I hate plastic spatulas! We all know that we aren't supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self. Well this isn't the case with Calphalon 1! Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear. 3) They "stick" and sear as well as cast iron cookware (it's a good thing). This is the best feature for me. Coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that's not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron. They "stick" for a reason. You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning. Now there's the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan. It's a no-brainer! 4) They look cool, have great handles, they're oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty. These are not cheap. If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don't buy this expensive set. It will dissapoint you. But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you. Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware 
Heavy-duty without being too heavy for a fairly weak cook to shift about. Easy to clean, both inside and out. One expects easy cleaning of non-stick interior, but the stainless steel outside comes clean with nothing more than hot, soapy water. The thick aluminum exterior bottom spreads heat evenly. I am impressed by the non-stick coating that seems impervious to ordinary wear, but will reserve judgment on that point for the one-year anniversary of my purchase 
I have 4 of these cookie sheets, and am ordering more. I bake in quantity, and these sheets are the only ones I've found that don't warp when heated, and that come clean without intense effort. They also maintain a very consistent heat, so that all the cookies on the sheet brown at the same time. 
Good knife, sharp, cuts well. However, I'm partial to the KitcheAid Chef's Knife. 
These bowls are wonderful - a great addition to my Winterberry collection, however they came packaged in the same packaging as they would in store, so during shipment they were broken. Amazon was great to send replacements, but some of those were broken too. I have finally received all dishes I ordered, but beware of receiving broken dishes 
Warped badly upon receipt. Too much of a pain to return it. It is already in the tras 
The slow cooker worked well the first time I used it. The second time, the light turned on, but it never heated up. I was disappointed, because the size was perfect for me. I'll try another brand 
The skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time. The quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet. Its much better then using teflon... (Did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds, especially parrots) Well I never liked cooking in teflon and I have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me. I am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection. Its important to realize, looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven... Those same skillets are still in use today.. Try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china. Just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to!!! 
I bought the Omega 8002 Juicer on the recommendation of Dr. Joseph Mercola, a holistic health MD who has a popular newsletter and website. We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices (including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much. The Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is "multifunctional"--the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10-year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work. So, how is it to USE the Omega? Well, it's EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are: 1. Install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing. 2. Pop a juicing cone (a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine. 3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle. 4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor. 5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing. 6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice. Now it's ready to start juicing. 1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. 2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I've never needed to do this. 3. Push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer. The food feeds along the screw, is broken up, and the juice is forced through the sieve (cone.) Out the nozzle comes the pulp. The juice flows out underneath, nearer to the motor. 4. When you are finished, turn off the motor, which is QUITE quiet--nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner. More like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor, for comparison. Dismantle the machine and wash the parts. A big bottle brush is included for this, very helpful. 5. Cleanup takes about 2-3 minutes and is mainly rinsing. The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it's ready to go again. The Omega juices kale, which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage. We now can do wheatgrass, once we grow some or find a source of flats of it. Just for grins, I tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding. It makes a fine grind--not something you'd use for hamburger. It would work for soft, somewhat grainy baby food or pate. I did not try making pasta. How does it compare to spinning cup type models, like the Braun which we previously used for juicing? 1. The spinning cup model (Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup-type juicer. Sounds like a blender. 2. The cup model cannot juice wheatgrass--the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants. It also can't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale. 3. The cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the Omega. The pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry. The pulp from the Omega, by contrast, is like slightly moistened sawdust--definitely drier. In summary, the Omega juicer, while pricier than the typical spinning cup models, is quiet and effective. It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price 
Yes, it's rather uncomely - it's outer casing is obviously plastic and, ours at least, doesn't have that same sheen as the example. It does look cheap. THAT being said, it's a VERY functional toaster. We've had NO problems in six+ months with variability - we know what we're going to get when we drop the lever. The plastic exterior DOES STAY COOL. So cool, in fact, that I promise you, you will forget normal toaster safety and burn yourself on the small exposed metal at the top. Yep, this is a GREAT toatser for someone who wants a functioning toaster and doesn't mind that it's an ugly duckling. An EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY 
First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor). When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this. At first I was thrilled. It was wonderful. After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction. Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt. I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me. I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked. Also the "dirt container" is sometimes hard to remove and put back. Feels like it's catching on something. What a waste of money. Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum. I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing. To me "Hoover" spells "DISAPPOINMENT" 
I saw the 3-star reviews here, but decided to ignore them as this pan was on sale for a very good price. That was a big mistake. 1. The first problem is with the size of the muffin cups -- they are significantly more shallow than in a typical mini-muffin pan. 2. The silicone warped from the heat while in the oven, spilling the meager contents of the tiny cups over the edges, making flat, crooked, ugly muffins. 3. The silicone did not release the muffins easily. I did spray it with nonstick spray before filling, and allowed the muffins to cool completely before I tried to get them out. I didn't even bother to try and wash it, so I don't have any comment about the ease of washing. I won't be wasting any more time and ingredients in it, so I threw it away. I wish I could get my money back. This is not the quality you would expect from KitchenAid 
This steamer sucks. Puts white goo all over the outside of unit and on counter. Wish I didn't buy it 
I purchased the Mix It In on 9/8/06 and used it the next day. I never got soft serve. I froze the bowl again, this time in my upright freezer, and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours. Today, I made soft serve!!!!!! It isn't perfect but I'm well on my way. I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent. To make this machine work for you here are some pointers: 1. If you don't have an upright or chest freezer, put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer. 2. Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours. 3. You can forget the 12-15 minute check described in the manual. You will not have a chance of having soft serv before a minimum of 25 minutes. I mixed as long as 40 minutes. 4. SAVE YOUR RECEIPT. Since the ice cream takes twice as long to mix as is suggested in the manual, you are using the motor 2x as much. Therefore, you might have to use the 3 year warranty. 
I strongly agree with the last reviewer- this unit is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED. I also have a all-metal zinc alloy unit that included 2 extra worms, aluminum foilcutter, stainless steel bottle stopper and pourer and gift box for $25. This one, at $150, still has a plastic body 
This bakeware is absolutley the best I have ever had. It doesn't stick, rust, or burn. Super easy to keep clean, just toss in the dishwasher. I you are a baker you must have this, you will be amazed 
This is a gorgeous ice bucket. It is large and stylish. However, I cannot recommend it because of the lid. The lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off. Instead, it pivots and swings up. The problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing. And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler. Poor design flaw. I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You'll notice in OXO's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up. Why? Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way. Hey OXO, that's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar! Would it have killed OXO to put a knob/handle on the lid and let the customer decide if they want the lid on or off? I swear sometimes I think manufacturers never bother actually testing out the things they design. If they had, surely they would have noticed how bad their lid idea was. Or they could have looked at every other ice bucket on the market to see that theirs is the only one in which the lid doesn't come off. That should have been a clue to them that there are obvious merits to having a removable lid. This bucket has a clear plastic lid. I don't understand why it's plastic at all. First of all, it's an ice bucket! I think everyone knows ice is inside without needing to peek through the lid. Secondly, a metal lid will keep the temperature inside colder longer than than a plastic lid. That is why the bucket is made of metal, not plastic. Metal is a better conductor of heat and cold. I wish I had noticed the lid before I purchased it. I didn't pay close enough attention. I suppose I assumed it was a normal lid that came off like all the others. Thankfully I got the bucket from my local Bed Bath Beyond making its return very easy. I am sorry I have to return it because this really is a nice looking bucket. However, I don't intend to spend $40 on an ice bucket just to sit there, look pretty and receive compliments--that's my job as hostess :-). I want an ice bucket that is functional too. Oh, well...my search for the perfect ice bucket continues. 
After cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan, I'm sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks. We've had this pan for maybe 8 months and I just assumed that pans lasted for several years. We even bought this pan plus the 8" for my mother-in-law for Christmas. What a disappointment. Better begin research on a new pan...and I'll make sure to read the reviews. 
What the heck is going on? I ordered this item 3 weeks ago, it has not delivered yet. So I can't even make a review on this item 
I got this to use with my rotisserie and have ended up using it everywhere I cook meat. Its ease of use and ease to clean makes it a favorite in my kitchen tool drawer. 
This thing tears through meat, I hate to chewy beef and stringy chicken, so this attachment is my new bud. Works fantastic on cereal to (dry not wet). Buy it, you won't regret it 
I got one of these as a x-mas gift a few years ago and love it! It is especially wonderful around the holidays. I like to make pies and it is great topping on all types of pies. We also drink a lot of flavored coffee and hot chocolate in the winter (its pretty cold here at night) and love to top it off with the cream. I'm not sure about the flavored syrups, but I just add some flavored coffee creamer (international delight or coffee mate) to the container and it makes it taste so good. It is such a hit at holiday parties that I have to borrow my mom's to keep up with the demand. It makes a great gift just be sure to get enough off the cartriage containers or you will run out 
it's 54.99 in last week, I'll wait till the price drop bac 
Nice pattern, but you cannot find the glasses that go with it 
I purchashed the Professional Series Tortilla Baker PS75791 to add healthy tortillas to my diet. I grind my own wheat berries and grow my oun yeast to make bread that is as fresh as it can be and is completed in 4 hours after grinding. A loaf cost just about 15 cents. I wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition. I am very pleased with the results. I grind my wheat, but leave out the oil because I submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking. The machine really works, and its easy to use. It a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen 
Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review. There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick. If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star? Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife. The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard "wave pattern" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife. I've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife. Pros: -Cheap Cons: -Mashes your bread while it cuts -Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness -The 'spiky' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread. Suggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade 
I have had my grill for a week, we've cooked lean steaks on it, pork chops, and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it. This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the "George Foreman" grill was a bit faster, I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast!! Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it. I gather some have not. And as to smoking I haven't had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat. Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke. I've only used water once, with the hamburgers (no smoking). This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying (actual cooking space is 15"x11"). Ease and comfort of use is amazing. I highly recommend it! 
Easily the worst toaster ever. Brendaa the 5 star above must have gotten the single toaster in the whole production series that actually worked. There are just not enough words in the English Language to describe this utterly useless peice of junk that will not hold toast down etc. etc.. Well, maybe not useless, if you are looking for something to bring about a cathartic welling of emotions that has you standing in the yard with a maul and and a toaster at your feet. I'd give it a minus 5 stars, but they do not even have a 0 star vote 
I purchased the Melitta Mill in April, it's now July and the thing is shot. We used it daily to grind 2 tablespoons of coffee, first the switches stuck and then we had to plug and unplug it to run the thing. Sure it was inexpensive, but you should get more than three months out of the purchase. $6+ a month just to grind coffee? Don't buy this poorly constructed product. 
I brought T-fal pans from my local Sam's Club wearhouse, and initially, the pans worked great. this is my review after about 1.5 years of use: 1. the handle on the lid (plastic) broke after about a year. 2. the non stick coating began to crack from regular use in about about 6 month, and it got so bad that i tossed the pan out in about a year and half. 3. the handle broke twice on me and for both time i super glued them back on. on the third time, i just tossed them out and got an expensive Anolon titanium non-stick set. 4. the pan is not made of aluminum and there are "hot / cold" spots on the pan. the hot / cold spot is caused by uneven distribution of heat. a good pan, generally with copper or aluminum core will evenly distribute heat. this pan does not. bottom line: do not use this pan in the oven eventhough the instruction said up to 400 degrees. the handle will and did crack on me for 3 times with occasional oven use. the pan is thin, and does not distribute heat well. and the worst: the non-stick coating is a joke. i found out that it's actually cheaper to get a expensive set and use it for like 10 years instead of getting a cheap set for a third of the price and replace it every 2 years or less. not recommended. 
Even though its a 10" bowl, its not deep enough for salads 
While these are pretty feel good in your hand, they rust. I had them for 3 days when several of the forks began forming rust inside the swirly patterns. They are not 18/10 as advertised - they are only 18/0...which is why they are rusting. I returned them promptly. 
Calling it short is a misnomer - it's not that short - it's an average size. It has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store. The turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods don't always want to cooperate but I'm pleased with it. I wouldn't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle - takes up too much room in my drawer 
These scissors are ideal for the kitchen. The size is nice, good grips fit well in the hand. They are sharp and appear to be easy to sharpen for the future. I especially like that they come apart easily for cleaning... and go back together easily also. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good quality, all-purpose kitchen scissor 
I bought one of these because I think that the idea of a slicer is good. Supposed to work with soft cheese, eggs, mushrooms and other soft items. The first time I used it I decided to try it with mushrooms and on the third mushroom the cutting wires broke. I would have returned it but for the price didn't think it was worth the trouble. So I just tossed it. Maybe mine was defective but I doubt it 
I'm really glad to have replaced my non-stick with the Cuisinart pans. I have been increasingly concerned about the safety of non-stick. I was really scared that they would stick and I would have to scrub them, but they've been really good so far. I'm not crazy about the hazy look that the bottoms get inside, but I know it's because I cook on med-high heat and I need to get some Barkeeper's friend. Overall, really pleased with this purchase, and I'm still adding to my set 
I've made everything from braised short ribs to homemade Mole in this and I can truly say it is fabulous. Goes from stovetop to oven perfectly and retains heat better than any cookware I've used. Cannot reccomend it highly enough 
Very nice, beats flimsy plastic. I have broken or otherwise worn out parts of plastic measuring sets. These will probably outlast me 
this set conducts heat really well and everything heats up fast but be careful not to burn anything which I did the first time using it. Also it takes a bit of scrubbing if you burn it bt other than that it's a great product 
Amazon took over a month in shipping me this roomba battery. It works ok. Also the list price is too high on this Amazon site. 
This grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen. It's very solidly built, unlike the old ones I have, and the non-skid base is pure genius. The grating surface is nice and sharp. I love the container that catches whatever you've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid. Although the container faithfully catches the grated material, there will be some spillage - from the outside of the grater - especially with cheese. One caveat: Since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use, you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating. Yup, I realized this the hard way, and boy was it a mess! Despite this, I highly recommend this kitchen essential 
This was a great toaster, until it starting turning itself on. After popping up the toast a few minutes later the heating elements will come back on. KitchenAid has a recall on their proline series with the same problem but there is no recall on this model, YET. Don't Bu 
This is a nice sturdy wooden knife block with plenty of slots 
This Krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used. I think the "built in safety" features are to blame. The finer the grind, the more water leaked out. Keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino. Using a coarse grind, which is usually only used for cowboy coffee out on the trail or French press machines, I still get quite a bit of leakage. Using finer grinds produces more and more leakage leaving only about half a carafe of extremely strong espresso which is indeed more like cowboy or french press coffees. -I enjoy cowboy coffee but would prefer espresso from my espresso machine plus I hate all the mess. The Krups machine I had fifteen years ago worked well but this machine sucks big time. If you don't want to fork over a lot of bucks for a "real" espresso maker, try a Mr Coffee espresso machine. Mine, which I use when I travel, cost less than twenty dollars and does not leak. In the meantime I have ordered a Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker to replace the Krups. -I'll keep you postsed. Billy Bat 
These knives are great. They are very sharp and of high quality. 
You know, for this price, you could throw anything away. But, this 'synthetic' comforter is so soft, silky and light, I can toss it on and not feel weighted down. I also have a cat and with cat hairs I can vacumn them off easily (down is more difficult), but just having the airy warmth is worth it. 
This is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings 
I love my Vienna Deluxe! We've been using it for 4-8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop. If you plan to buy more than 100 coffees (for us about 3 months worth) it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better. The flavor of the coffee is awesome and it's super easy to make. The only bad thing I can say about this coffee machine is that the 'key' in the back of it got a little bit off and we had to manually turn it so that the brew unit would fit back in. It only took us about 2 hours to figure out and fix it, so it wasn't that big of a deal. If you're looking for something that is a super high class, fancy, heavy duty, professional style coffee maker, maybe you should spring for the superdeluxe big bucks model and drop a couple grand. People have given this model low reviews for being expensive and made of plastic. Ours still looks nice, is easy to clean, and doesn't weigh 750 million pounds. It seems like folks are looking for a chrome and steel Starbucks style coffee maker for $500, and that just isn't realistic. This is a great buy and it makes great coffee 
It does the job, cook my sushi rice perfectly and no burn. So much better than my old black and decker 
I just love Fiestaware and this is the perfect chili bowl! It is a great size for chili or soup! The quality is fantastic adn the price was very good 
You have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel...the advantage of that? You can dishwasher stainless. But you can't dishwasher nonstick! You just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath. And then you put teflon on something that costs over $100...the pan will last 50 or more years, the nonstick about five if you use it lightly and don't let some idiot put metal on it ever. There's no indication that they will resurface your pan either...the warranty just covers defects, not use. I think this is very wasteful economically, if not environmentally (because it is a massive yet not durable product, even if you recycle it). You can get a cheaper nonstick that will serve you for the five years just fine (e.g. Calphalon commercial), and better you can get this pan without the teflon and learn how to season your own cookware and make it even more nonstick than this can ever be and yet utterly indestructible, even with metal utensils. People will only buy this for the looks. After all, they don't know how to cook anyway 
The Corningware dish is great, my 1 star is not for the item, it is for Dynadirect. They are HORRIBLE! Item was backordered, but they never told me and charged my credit card. When I called they finally told me it was backordered and I ask that they cancel the order and refund my money. Bad, Bad Servic 
This product has a cute name, but it is very difficult to use. I constantly have to take the nutmeg out and re-adjust it. Larger nutmegs do not fit in the storage area. It's a lot of work to get a little bit of nutmeg - disappointing 
I sent this knife to my son who is a baker by profession--he loves this knife. It doesn't mash the bread and cuts through crusty crusts! I higly recommend it to anyone 
I suspected that a daylight spectrum lamp might be a complete hoax. I work in an interior office with no view of natural light. That's 8-10 hours a day in a room with flourescent lighting! When I would come in, I would feel foggy and depressed and unmotivated. When I would leave, I would feel blinded by the light outside and out of sorts. So I bought this lamp on a whim from a Sharper Image Store. It comes with a brushed steel lampshade, but the store also gave me a white translucent vinyl shade which is what I wound up using. The light is softly diffused around my workspace. I can increase or decrease the intensity of the light using the dimmer dial. And honestly, whether it's psychological or whatever, I feel SO much better since I plugged this thing in! I am perky, motivated and when I walk outside, I don't feel shocked anymore. I would recommend this lamp to anyone who works lengthy hours indoors without natural light. Employers, BUY THIS FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES-IT'S A GODSEND AND IT LOOKS COOL TOO 
I love this tea kettle. It not only looks great but is of heavy duty construction unlike those $10 aluminum throw-aways. Since I am only an occasional tea drinker, I tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling (I have cast iron elements/electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use). Other tea kettles create rusty water, since water remains in the kettle. Not this one! It boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove. My handle does not get hot and, like I said, I have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot. I do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit. That's the only flaw; they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle 
I got these as part of our wedding registry here on Amazon and with about 2 months of use I am very happy with this set. More so than any other set of pots/pans that I own. Here are some pro's: 1 - The non-stick is truly non-stick and so easy to use. The fact that the outside is non-stick also makes cleaning up easy. 2 - The handle really does stay cool, even near the edge on gas burners 3 - The size of all 9 pieces are very convenient 4 - Easy to wash due to non-stick and dishwasher safe 5 - Thermospots assists in cooking evenly 6 - Oven safe Great price and value 
We bought this to use at events for a chocolate-themed group at college, and used it several times before giving up. The cord is in the way, you need a shallow dish to pour the batter into so you can dip the crepe maker, and the crepes tend to fall off half-baked. We eventually gave up---now we just put chocolate on waffles 
I bought one of these to make Bagna Cauda, and upon loading the necessary ingredients and depressing the "high" button, it sparked and died. Well, ok, I guess it only *half* died, as the "pulse" button would still work, if I leaned on it with my entire weight, but both the "high" and "low" switch settings did nothing. So I'm thinking next time I'll spend a little more; meanwhile, this little guy goes back 
I love this fryer! Its just the right size for my kitchen.Its not big and bulky like other fryers. Its easy to clean too. Its a winner in my book 
I've had two of these break on me now after normal use; the hinge gives way during the "cleaning" process 
I've had my share of dutch ovens in my time, and I have to say that this is the foulest one yet. I thought I smelled a good deal when I got it, but boy was I mistaken 
I have tried to like this pot - in theory it sounds great, but in actual usage, it is very problematic. The non-locking handles are the chief drawback - you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining - and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you. Back to the tried and true colander in the sink for me 
I used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. Just to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don't need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat. Not cooking for a crowd? Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won't want to share. I don't slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is. In fairness, when I gave my neice two of my unused large pastry/baking mats, she used them successfully to make her chocolate dipped strawberries, turtles, etc. 
We've had 3 sets in just over 1-1/2 years. Return policy is great but it's a hassle. Can't Oneida make silverware that doesn't rust? I'm going to try a different brand 
Nordic Ware makes the best looking pans, but this is my favorite pan from Nordic Ware! This pan makes beautiful breads and cakes. Because it has a non-stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher setting when baking. And even though it is non-stick, I suggest that you spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick! It's also very easy to clean up 
I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch. I had read other reviews of the Bissell Little Green Machine that were unfavourable, so headed off to the store to find something else . . . . the Atlantis Express looked interesting, and I hadn't seen it before. Suffice to say, it did get the cat stains out of the couch, but not after revealing itself as a really poorly designed product. - The machine is LOUD, very loud - The cleaning 'head' on the end of the hose has a 'flip-up' cover to make it easier to clean where it sucks in lint and stuff into the machine. That is a great idea, but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor, it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up. - The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine. However to accomplish this, the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside. Neither are centered, the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse. As they are not centered, they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head. To top it off, when you release the trigger, the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments, meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere. While it functioned well enough to clean my couch, it was a brutal and terrible experience. When I bought it I figured it could be used too on my car interior . . . . but the frustration of cleaning a small patch on my couch quickly quelled that thougt. I returned the Atlantis Express to the store and went out and bought a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. -- which I should have done right from the start--- the hoover runs circles around this machine 
Best 20$ I've ever spent. It does have some flaws as stated previously in other reviews, the knobs are hard to read but I've found that I use it so much that I really don't need to be able to see it anymore. The thermometer seems stable, I never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter, and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well. The cord is 'regular' length so it's not tiny and I don't need an extension cord. Over all on a students budget I've definitely found a winner 
After checking every store I could think of and accepting that I'd have to go online, I laughed out-loud when I saw this price! What was Mr. Coffee thinking? I read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that I don't even need them! Duh, I have filtered water in our house! Thank you Mr. "Train Man." The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it's not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing. 
This tool makes even the toughest jar a breeze to open, accommodating a range of sizes easily. I'm sending one to everyone in my family this Christmas 
Cuisinart does not stand behind their products. We purchased a 10 pc set and after using the 1 � qt pan only once it formed a bubble on the bottom of the pan causing the pan not to lay flat on the stove. This actually renders the pan useless as it does not evenly disperse the heat and takes forever to even heat up. Upon notifying Cuisinart of the problem this is the response we got: "Thank you for your reply. The cookware does have a limited lifetime warranty against any manufacturing defects. However, if the pot has been over heated or damaged in any way it would not be covered under warranty. You may send the item into us for an evaluation. You may send it to the following address listed below, with a check or money order for $7.00 return shipping and we will evaluate the cookware for you: Cuisinart Corporation 150 Milford Road East Windsor, NJ 08520 Thank you for your use and interest in Cuisinart products. Very truly yours, Ann Marie Cuisinart Representative" Why should I have to pay for shipping their defective product?The cost of shipping the product just to have it "evaluated" makes it a wiser choice to just forget the warranty and buy a new one. However the wisest choice would be to steer clear of this company's products altogether. By the way the pan was only used to boil some eggs. 
I've used a pair of Emperor 400 filters on a 75 gallon tank continuously for the past five years or so. So far, neither has needed attention other than filter changes and recently, new impellers. After five years, the constantly spinning impellers had worn their shafts and bushings to the point where they made a rattley noise, although they still moved water effectively. Replacing the impellers was an easy repair, and restored the unit to almost total silence. The filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new, as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones. I'm still using the original biowheels, with no end in sight. For almost anyone, a single Emperor would provide adequate filtration, however at the time I purchased them, I had seven huge goldfish in the tank, who produced vast quantities of waste matter. Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish. The big selling feature for the Emperor 400 is the dual biowheels, which provides a highly oxygenated living space for beneficial bacteria to colonize. These bacteria help remove some of the waste products which the fish produce, resulting in healthier fish, and extending the time interval between water changes, and thus reducing maintainence of the aquarium. Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level. These filters are made of a black, slightly flexible plastic which seems to be less brittle than the transparant material used on some other filters. As others have mentioned, each filter has four slots for filter cartridges. And the filter comes with two refillable media containers which can occupy two of those slots, if you choose to use them. Then can hold extra carbon, zeolite, or other material. I have mine filled with porous ceramic noodles. The Emperor 400 has a control for water volume, so you can turn it down when feeding your fish, preventing all the food from being sucked into the filter. After the fish have finished eating, the volume can be set back to "high", however I have left it in the second slowest postion for weeks at a time, and the fish seemed to be content. I have found that if the volume control is not moved for a long time, it tends to accumulate mineral deposits and become stiff. So, I turn it down every day when feeding, then turn it back up a couple of hours later. Also, if the power is interrupted while water volume is turned down, the filter takes longer to prime itself and begin pumping properly. If power fails when volume is turned up, the filter restarts with no problem when power is restored. The Emperor 400 comes with a cleaning brush for the spray bars and an extension for the water intake to be used if you have a very deep tank. My own tank is fairly deep, and the extension would bring the intake nearer the bottom, however I don't use the extension, and filtration seem fine. When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows: Two inches of "Eco-Complete planted aquarium substrate" soil purchased in sealed bags at the local store AquariumConnection. The soil is intended for use in aquariums with live plants, which feed on some of the wastes. In the soil, there are approximately 20 Anubis plants scattered around the tank. The fish love to swim between and around the leaves, or hide behind them. From time to time, eggs are laid on the leaves of the plants. The bright green leaves stand out in vivid contrast against the nearly black soil. Two 15 watt fluorescent lights provide illumination to stimulate photsynthesis in the plants. I strongly recommend that you do NOT use any type of gravel, colored or otherwise, as food falls down into the gravel where fish cannot reach it, and where it rots and fouls the water. If you choose to use gravel, you MUST vacuum the gravel on a weekly basis, and your water still will not be as clean. Gravel equals more work and dirtier water. Sand is better than gravel as food cannot fall down into the sand, but sand still doesn't provide nutrition for live plants. Use Eco-Complete soil or something comparable, both you and your fish will be happier. I also recommend that you do NOT use any type of undergravel filter, as these will also require frequent vacuuming, and eventual dismantling of the tank to clean beneath the filter plate. With the Emperor, you won't need additional filters. And again, undergravel filters equal more work and lower water quality. I NEVER vacuum the soil, and perform a 20% water change every couple of months, usually when I change filter cartridges. The fish themselves consist of a number of cory catfish, who snuffle around through the soil and pick up whatever falls from above. There are as well golden tetras, cardinal tetras, redline tetras, silver dollars, danios, flying clouds, and mollies, and one otocinclus catfish. Some of the cory catfish are grandfathers several times over, and have grown to a large size in the five years or so they have lived in this tank. I feed them once each day, around 6:00 pm. Supper consists of several spirulina wafers, plus a pinch of flake food about the size of a nickle, which I crush between my fingers to produce many very fine particles. To sum up, the Emperor 400 is an efficient and durable filter which will help provide good water quality and healthy fish. 
I got this with my food saver. It cracked in just a few uses. I'm not pleased with Jardian either. I was injured and can't talk when I tried to turn in a complaint by Email. They said I needed to get a friend or family member to call them on the phone in order to get help. What ever happened to equal access for the handicapped? Maybe we handicapped should take our business elsewhere 
I have always used Rubbermaid or Tupperware plastic storage, but I replaced all of them with Pyrex glass storage containers in May of 2005. I was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when I washed it in the dishwasher. Also, I liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad. Unfortunately, I have not been happy with this product. The Pyrex lids must be pried off with a great deal of strength and diligence. This is not a task for a child, or even a standard adult. I have had to ask my husband on more than one occasion to take a lid off for me. I have even spilled food in attempts to take lids off. As an aside, I have also found that the Pyrex glass is heavy, which makes it less desirable to carry leftovers to work AND the containers do not "nest," so they take up more space than they need to in the cabinet. I recommend Bormioli glass storage containers instead. They are lighter in weight, they nest, and the lids come off with the strength of a normal person. 
I love the toaster oven. I used it about every day. Strongly recommend this to buyers. 
I was so excited at the prospect of having a 3-cup mini chopper. I thought it would be ideal for hummus, which I hate to scrape out of my blender. However, it was very disappointing. On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped. If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no? I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped. I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping. I never had to take the top off of it. Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs. Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad! 
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother. I was very excited when it arrived much sooner than I had anticipated. I opened it up, so that I could give it to my mom assembled. Unfortunately, an entire corner was broken off and the other corner was cracking and splintering. The packing materials are insufficient to say the least. I immediately called target's customer service, and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table. Despite my dissapointment about the broken table I was glad that Target did the best they could to resolve my issue without any hassle. <br /> <br /> 
I purchased one like this last December.On the 13th month I owned it it began to leak from the spout.I emailed Breville 2-3 times and they never even responded!Their web site states they always respond within 3 days.Don't believe them and don't buy a product from this company 
The spoon handle is crooked and there are marks/damage to the wood. Avoid 
I just got one of these nifty looking Canisters, but mine seems to spell out "Tea of Cowage" ! LOL.. It seems the script of the u merged with the r and thus made a 'w'.. There is no space between the lower case u and r. Too funny! Thanks Pfaltzgraff! Good production Quality Control! If I could post a picture of it here in this review I Would! Edit: I did get a second one of these shipped from Amazon, and that one also had the misspelling. Will someone who has purchased one of these recently Please post a review and mention if this product Still says "Tea Of Cowage"? THANKS 
You are going to LOVE this mug. I bought it in the curry yellow, and ended up buying three more. The finish is beautiful and the shape fits your hand so well. It is like satin as you hold it and it keeps your tea warm and wonderful. The lip is perfect and not too thick. Buy one and see!! Chantal products are the best. Check out their soup bowls 
This knife has a lot to offer as far as I'm concerned. I'm not looking for a highlife line of knives...because I have a family--all of which do not respect special care of important knives. I want a knife that cuts well..thats sturdy...and can take some abuse like being in water or not being cleaned right away. I do not buy wood handles anymore either...because too many times the knife goes in the water or is not cleaned promptly. I also want one that will stay sanitary...or can be sanitized. This santuko by Cuisinart fits the bill for me. The weight is excellent for me...I have a large hand for a woman...and some health issues for which I prefere a lighter handling knife that cuts without a lot of pressure...and will not make my wrist ache when used . Cuts like a dream through all the fruits and veggies I tried it on. Washed up easy and quick...dried quick too. I paid only a little bitty amount for this very big hearted knife. I recommend it for all real cooks out there... that also have family using your stuff 
We love this thing. The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board. We have a small house and not alot of wiggle room, so space saving is key for us. Also,I hate ironing; sleeves, collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear. With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie. On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing. 
I have to admit that this is not as handy as I hoped. It is big and clumsy and it's a little too flexable 
We now have two of these units. They are quieter than other HEPA air filtration units we have had, do a better job of cleaning the air, and have excellent product support. 
I really like the hampers. They don't take up a lot of floor space and with three, I can separate the laundry. The handles make it easy to move them. They are a little deeper than my arms are long (I'm short) but I can tilt them to empty them. Would have liked having an assortment of colors to choose from 
Inside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays, one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse. Each tray has a cup coming out the bottom which is used to lock the tray into the device. After only 3 uses the base of the one cup cracked. After about 6 more uses the other bottom cracked. I would not recommend this product to anyone. 
Cleaning up is so easy now. The other roaster pan we used would allow the juices to bake on and it you would have to soak it, scrub it and scrape it. I love this stuff! 
We own a set of 2-Man Pro series and this set did not even compare. Returned them the same day they arrived to my house 
With the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us. We like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee. Most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing. But you must use their carafe. With this maker you can use your own mug. And if the carafe breaks (and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes) you can still use the maker with the mug or other container. I sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher. Sure this maker isn't fancy, but I just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that doesn't take up lots of counter space. I haven't had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker 
So glad I bought this turner! It's very flexible and I can get under and flip my omelette/pancake beautifully. I love how I can now scrape the pan clean (as hard as I want) without leaving any scratches. It's very easy to clean too. 
To start with, the one-star rating is actually for the customer service department. When it works, the product itself is fine. I bought the unit last Christmas and used it frequently until early summer. At that time it began functioning only intermittently, then soon quit altogether. Tilia assurred me that it was covered under a one-year warranty, that it would be replaced, and that I needn't return the original unit. Our next call was prompted by its failure to arrive in a reasonable time. We were told that they had no replacements, it was back-ordered, and would arrive within several weeks. When it didn't, I called again and was told that the replacements had arrived and would be shipping soon. Our next call yielded the information that the replacements had NOT arrived afterall and that Tilia had no idea when they would. The saga continues... Get a food saver--but from another company rather than Tili 
This may sound odd, but this is the first steamer that I have ever had. So needless to say, I do not have others to compare it to. However,I find that I use it more than I thought I would! The unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that I most use for vegies and the like, and when I pull out the sides (the steaming tray) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot. Besides your basic steamed vegies, I find that it's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice, leaving it hot and fluffy. I like that the handle extends, so you can keep the cover on it while cooking, but you can extend the handle for easier lifting. And you can't beat the price 
I have gone through 2 of these now and both ceramic inserts have cracked in the same place! Cuisinart customer service is not interested in replacing the inserts even though I have only used it 2 times before they cracked and were unusable. I had to send the pot back for replacement and the replacement had the same trouble. My cheap Rival crockpot that I had for years before I purchased this one never had problems or I would think that this was operator error. I was really looking forward to using this because I love all my other Cuisinart products but I am going today to purchase a nice, inexpensive, reliable Rival crockpot. 
The vacu vin wine saver works great, it keeps wine fresh in the refrigerator for weeks. Also it is very easy to use 
The Breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states. To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, "no messy ice". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don't really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink. It does work being faster than your fridge or freezer, but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated 
I received this item last week and immediately tried it. It was easy to use and worked quite fast. Needed much less marinating juice to get the job done. I wish it was also available in a bigger size for a larger group. 
I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection. Go the old fashioned way, with a tray and a liner 
The other reviews are correct,except they fail to mention that the fan does not move air.That is why it is so quite.I do suppose that I got 13 dollars worth of fan though.Think twice about purchasing this fan 
This is a great food slicer for the home kitchen, (dont compare apples with oranges, this isnt a commercial slicer, but it wasnt advertised as one either) it works great for anything from bacon to tomatos. It has a powerfull motor and a very sharp blade with infinite thinkness adjustments up to a 1/2, easy to clean and very well built. If you want a good slicer for home use you'll be happy with a waring food slicer 
These Bodum glasses are simply amazing. There's no other way to describe a glass out of which I can have my coffee in the morning and ice cold liquids at night. The added bonus is that liquid of any kind becomes a work of art in these glasses. The liquid is suspended in space, and to top off the experience, the glasses never sweat and they never feel hot or cold to the touch. Totally awesome...worthy of more than 5 stars 
it simply doesn't do the job. only bruises the herbs. i normally love oxo products, but this one is a disappointment 
Theres not alot I can say about measuring spoons really. They are made to a high standard, durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. At this price I dont see why you would need to pay more for a set of measuring spoons unless it was for decorative reasons 
My living room (approx 12'x16' and open to the kitchen) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day. It sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it. The Bionaire BW2300 cools it in half the time it used to take. ~Edit: My statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time I once did is inaccurate. If the outside temp is lower than inside, the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours.~ It also does a great job circulating air when its hot out (and in) to keep the room from feeling stuffy. I have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have. The temp gauge on mine works well. ~Edit: The thermometer reads the temp of fan's exact location, not the room's temperature. For example, in the afternoon sun, mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature. When it is colder outside at night, it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp. ~ Is it really quiet? Yes! I have a Vornado fan, which is quite quiet for a fan. This is even quieter (although not silent). To accomodate different window sizes, this model comes with a built-in extender, and two add-on extenders. The fan with extenders isn't large enough to fit my 38.5" window width. I could order another add-on extender from the manufacturer, but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead. What comes in the box? The fan, two extenders, two AAA batteries and the remote. ~Edited 7/28/06: I bought a second one for my bedroom. Its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees. The slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model. So I cannot direct the air onto (or away from) a particular area of the room. 
This bowl does not work with the ICE-45 ice machin 
I love this coffeepot. I had the older version and had a problem with the timing light but so far this works great. It's very easy to set up the timer and looks great sitting on the counter. I'm the only coffee drinker in the house and I love the fact you can just hold a cup underneath and get all the coffee you want without the burnt taste. Would highly recommend to everyone 
I'm a single 47 year old guy. I'm not a great cook. I've lost 25# (am now down to 168) and am trying to eat better. This makes it easy! No more nuking junk food, or frying food covered in fat, just steam it. No more worries about burning things (the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done). I bought the Oster 5712 last week. I've cooked boiled eggs, frozen chicken breast, Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far. It rocks! Tonight I'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I'm 99.9% sure it will turn out great even though I've never tried it before. This baby makes cooking easy. Cleaning it is also easy. No burnt food on it, just hot water. For cleaning it's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater. Just a bit of soap and spray it off. As far as price vs functionality this thing is a steal! - Jo 
Firstly, I am into high quality at an affordable price, so I thank Cuisanart for providing just that in all of their cookware. Two-quarters are the most handy in my kitchen and at least one non-stick needs to be available. I use mine more and more just for the ease of clean-up. The interior finish seems durable and shows no signs of damage. I would expect it to last a very long time with reasonable care. The price is great for the quality; you'll be pleased with your purchase. 
When I decided to buy this oven, I was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven. I stumbled across this item looking for cookware. I read all the reviews, thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it. Boy, am I glad that I did!!! And so is my family. The day we received it, I cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack. Extremely easy. All I needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me. Since then, we have cooked more muffins, a meatloaf, bacon, toast, english muffins, chicken strips, waffles and bratwurst. My kitchen doesn't heat up like when I use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven. It was so easy for my husband to use this also while I was shopping and I just gave him a 15 second class before I left. I didn't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods. This is my first Convection Toaster oven, which has replaced the microwave and toaster, and I can assure you we expect to use this oven alot. I love the design, the warming tray does just that, even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm. It's great! The oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance. I would recommend this to anyone. What a great idea for the kitchen 
This is horrible.....as stated by the other reviews!!! Do NOT waste your money or time!!! My husband and I tried for several hours to get this to work, we let the dough come to room temperature, and still it would NOT work! 
Very annoying that you can't get the filters for this coffee maker anywhere 
I've been using one of these little gems for over 20 years and it still works flawlessly. Great output grind adjustment. The only other pepper mill that I could recommend (in addition to this one) is the Unicorn Magnum Plus Pepper Mill (9-in.). The Perfex is "the" pepper mill that every well equipped kitchen should have 
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND AFTER SHE REMOVED IT FROM THE BOX I TOOK A LOOK AT IT TO CHECK IT OVER AND I DISCOVERED THERE WAS MISSING PAINT WHERE THE BAND IS THAT GOES AROUND THE TOP OF THE MIXER. DO I GET THE FEELING THAT THE MIXER I PURCHASED WAS A DEFECT. I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE FOR MY OTHER DAUGHTER AND I WILL HAVE HER CHECK THAT OVER ALSO. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS AND I WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER 
I ordered this the early part of December, so had it in time for the Christmas season. I am so very pleasantly surprised about the power and efficiency of this one. It is small so storage is a breeze, and the capacity of the bowl is just right for any chopping, etc. that you need to do. This is my new favorite appliance 
The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom 
I received this grinder as a Christmas gift from my son-in-law after my cheapo, cheapo grinder went kaput! I am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day, sometimes twice in one day, and it works really well. If the grinder is dedicated for coffee or spices, there's no need to clean it (like, with water and soap; just tap around the outside canister and all the excess residue falls off the edges into the cup/blade area. I really like the grinder, and knowing my luck, this Cuisinart will last a long time only because I've had my eye on a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder (to match the rest of my appliances) and just happened to get this one as a gift. Oh well! But, the grinder is worth the money, and it does what it's supposed to do. Unless you're the type of person who needs directions on how to breathe, this grinder is a no-brainer :- 
Wish I'd had this pan years ago - it would have saved me at least a year in clean up time! Nothing sticks to the pan! It cooks beautifully is well worth the price. With a lifetime warranty, super easy clean up, and utensil "safe", it is a great investment! If I cooked more often, I would buy the larger Swiss Diamond also. 
These sheets are pretty good--they're nice and heavy, and I definitely feel like they're going to last a looooong time. They are a little bit stiff, and they don't seem to be softening up too much as time goes on. I expected them to be a ton softer. They are really good sheets, however, and I would buy them again 
The temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected! Over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it. This means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything (which granted is not everyone). Last time I buy an oven thermometer in which the markings don't sit behind a glass face! 
The V2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about $250. Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality 
I knew going in that these were not "thick", but I am pleased with these sheets. Would I buy them again? Yes, aslong as the price is as low as I got them for (under 20 bucks) 
i have to echo what was said, cheap not up to what you would expec 
I owned a Rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it. When it stopped working I therefore bought another (this one) from Rival. I've used it twice. The top doesn't seem to keep the liquid in, even on low, and it burned the food both times. I don't trust it now and am not sure whether I'll try it again. 
Had I known what a difference this would make with my cooking, I would have bought one a long time ago. Everything is faster, now, and everything I mix, from potatoes to icing, comes out smoother, too. There are a variety of things you can make with this mixer, and I use mine a lot. Perhaps not every single day, but almost. I bake bread with it every few days, and I decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side. My mixer has never let me down. In fact, I am buying an extra bowl just for convenience, too. Sometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up. They even tell you in your mixer's manual to expect it and that it is normal. I've had mine for almost a year, now, and was waiting until I had it awhile before I reviewed it. But I have yet to have any problems with it. It's cut preparation time more than half for everything I've made with it. From cakes to meatloaf and bread. It's sturdy and somewhat heavy, which means it's not going to easily be knocked off your counter. It does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over. However, if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full, you will still want to use the stir speed until it's a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess. Not a big one, but a mess nonetheless. It comes with a book of recipes, but I've only used a few. I've never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs I've mixed with it, however. In fact, I've made more cookies just since getting this than I did for years before. It's just so convenient and easy that I don't mind. I mean heavy doughs, too, like monster cookies and peanut butter m cookies, etc. I don't know what else to say about it. I don't think you will be disappointed in this purchase. I'm usually someone who doesn't like to spend a lot of money, but this was more than worth it, and I will be buying my daughter one someday, too 
Stainless my foot! I received these from my wedding registry and only just used them for Thanksgiving this weekend. After one run through the dishwasher, several pieces are rusted, the finish has worn off, and they are even pock-marked in places! I too threw away the box when I first took them out, and cannot find *any* information on warranty or how to contact Cambridge Silversmiths. I've bought cheap individual pieces of stainless for *camping* that stood up better than this. I wish I'd put Oneida on my registry instead of this crap 
I bought this scale back in Jan or Feb. I needed one and after looking around for a while found that I liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display- pounds on one side, ounces (down to the tenth) on the other side. The lb/k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and I don't find it inconvient down there. This scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while I'm in the middle of measuring. Because of previous complaints to that effect when I first got mine I timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2.5 min before it did. I also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish, very clean lines and is easy to clean too, just a quick wipe down and I'm done. As a note to Alton Brown fans this is his scale of choice on Good Eats. The price tag may have you shying away but I assure you that its worth every penny. I would not trade mine for anything! 
Let me begin with a positive note on the OXO Good Grips oven mitt: It looks great and the magnet is a good idea. Now for the negative aspects of this item: it's WAY over-priced, especially for how poorly it is designed. The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a "Good Grip," which is ironic since it's called the "OXO Good Grips" oven mitt. It's hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you're trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan). It's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven. I decided not to give it one star ONLY because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures. I strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this OXO mitt, you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design. 
I received the shipment very quickly despite not paying for the shipping. I love the skillets. They're very heavy duty and are a great addition to my Circulon cookware 
After many years of loving Rowenta irons I have to say I am very disappointed the DX1700. It has already "died" on me. The first few months it worked very well. The steam power that most Rowenta's have is great. But I am very disappointed that it will no longer heat up. 
Ugly and Cheap looking Wife hated them now using as rags to wash the ca 
I just keep buying more of these glasses, including other sizes and shapes. They look good and are great at keeping drinks hot or cold 
I did not realise how much I needed a new one till I got the new one 
Le Creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron Chinese-styled wok. It looks like a Chinese wok, and it is made of iron, but essentially it is not Chinese. The wok is much thicker than a Chinese iron wok, and therefore takes much longer time to warm up. Some American users praised the wok by saying it does not need much fire, yet the essence of Chinese stir-frying is cooking through large fire: one heats a thin Chinese carbon iron wok with large fire, puts in vegetable or animal oil, and then does the entire stir frying in less than a few minutes. Still, I liked the wok after purchasing it. The Chinese food here in the US usually is not really Chinese food in essence, but people like it. Why should I be so critial to a French cast iron wok which looks like a Chinese wok? 
We purchased this corkscrew as a gift for our daughter. On her first attempt to use it at a holiday dinner party, we found that it required an unreasonable amount of strenghth to uncork a bottle of wine. After contacting Amazon.com customer service, our entire $39.95 purchase price was refunded in the form of a gift certificate under their extended holiday gift return policy. Recently our daughter had an opportunity to use a corkpuller of a similar design. It removed a cork with far less effort. In summary, we offer a rating of 5 stars for our Amazon.com buying experience and a rating of 1 star for the Metrokane Rabbit corkpuller. 
This is a fantastic idea for teaballs. Sleek and stylish, this set is also practical. The two teaballs are spring-loaded, and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea. Simply press the plunger, then stir the ball around in your loose tea container. Lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea. Let go of the plunger, and the teaball closes securely. The long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup (or stir the tea as it's brewing, if that's your preference) without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water. Prior to this purchase, we used a tea 'spoon', which also spring-loaded shut. The problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea, you have to hold it vertically in the container, which means you have few options - either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides, and fill your cup with loose tea, or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container, and get tea all over your counter. Because of these teaballs' design, they don't share that problem. The tower has one interesting feature, but some shortcomings. The good design is that below where each teaball hangs, there is a significant 'bowl' to catch any tea that might still be dripping. This has proven to be a very handy feature. The tower itself isn't very mobile, however. Due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems, it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out. Also, when I got mine, the tower was visibly crooked, and I had to bend it back straight. That worked for me, but was quite hard, and I was worried I'd break it. Oh, cleanup - cleanup is much easier than with the aforementioned spoon. The spoon hinges so that there is little clearance at the back of the utensil for washing out. These balls don't share that problem at all. The plunger gives more than adequate clearance to simply turn the ball sideways and wash it out in the sink (just make sure your sink's filter is in!) All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase. It's such a fantastic idea that a few shortcomings don't significantly mar how well the product works 
I realize I'm in the minority here, but I do not find this can opener comfortable to use. The crank does have a "good grip", but I'm not trying to grip it, I'm trying to turn it. I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down. The knob's shape (relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring. It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i'm opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway (which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO) 
This is a wonderfully efficient zesting tool. If you find that you need a zester more than even once a year you should invest in this nifty little product. It boasts solid construction with an easy grip rubberized handle and 5 sharp holes for quick and easy zesting. Very easy to hold and twist when zesting. It even has a little channel knife if you want to do some fancy peeling. This beats the heck out of trying to zest with a cheap grater type device and is vastly superior to trying to zest with the edge of a knife. (As I did for years before I learned better) I use lemon and lime zest quite a bit more than the average person and I see no signs that this tool will dull, break, or wear out anytime soon. Highly recommended tool for any active zester. As easy to wash as a fork. Cool 
While these are described as "beer" glasses, they are fantastic for keeping milk cold through a meal. I actually pour the milk and place the glasses in the freezer while I start dinner. These glasses are easy to clean and retain their "sunny" shine, even though we have very hard water. NO SPOTS! Great product 
This product has been great. The price is about half similar sized crates you can find at a pet store. The only difference is the metal is a little thinner but if your dog is not aggressive, it should be fine. Also, their is only one side door, doesn't have the 2 door options that higher priced crates have, BUT that didn't matter in our case. This door was actually larger and our puppy found it easier to go in and out. For the price, it's a great product 
Unfortunately, I ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead. This was *not* Amazon's fault, but Emile Henry's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not. In fairness to Amazon, they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled. Althought I would have preferred the oval bakers, I kept the rectangular ones and do like them 
The Food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase. I know I was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it's an Excellent food processor and worth more than the money. My wife LOVES you know guys waht that means. Also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow. The seller was more than Excellent. 
same lifespan as single brita filters, lower price. only wish the indicator wasn't the slowness of the filter 
I HAVE THE ARTISAN KITCHENAID MIXER AND THIS COVER IS TOO BULKY FOR IT. IT IS TOO LONG AT THE BOTTOM AND JUST UNPLEASING TO THE EYE. WOULD RECOMMEND JUST LEAVING YOUR MIXER UNCOVERED. HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL 
I am a quilter and was looking for a good hot iron and lots of steam. I also hate the auto- shut off. Well I thought I had found it. The perfect iron for my needs. Well after only one days use it is put away for someone else to use I was very disapointed in the iron it spits water and boy do I mean spit my ironing board cover was wet. My fabric continued to to roll under the iron, the surface is not smooth and seems to grap the fabric. Not what I was looking for at all I would not recommend this iron 
I make homemade stocks a lot, so having a good separater that can handle a large quantity is really useful. This one works well, and thanks to its design, it cleans up easily in the dishwasher. I have another one with a very thin spout and I have to wash it by hand if I let it sit at all after using it because the dishwasher jets can't seem to get into its narrow opening; it's a real pain. I do not have that problem with this design. To answer another reviewers' question on plasic vs. glass separaters -- I had a glass one and it broke despite being touted as heat resistant glass. When I poured hot gravy into it last Thanksgiving, the glass went flying everywhere as it broke right in my hand! Admittedly, that was an older one and perhaps the newer glass versions are more rugged when it comes to heat. But I just don't have that worry using a plastic one. I'm not an industrial designer, but given the way that plastic is made at exceptionally high heat, I am not aware of any health implications regarding pouring warm liquids into plastic 
I'm usually a big fan of KitchenAid appliances and I own a Proline coffee grinder, which is excellent. But, I could not get a good full-flavored cup of coffeee out of this machine. I usually brew 4 cups at a time. They have a setting for 1-4 cups, but the coffeee still turned out slightly weak and slightly bitter. I returned it and will try something else 
I bought this hand blender for making split pea soup. Using the hand blender made the soup so much creamier. My husband has Diabetes 2 and he loves his sweets. I make him the instant, no sugar, no fat pudding and by using the hand blender it becomes very creamy and so much more palatable. So far the blender is working just great 
They are very big, the spoons are very uncomfortable to use, they should have been smaller. and a better grip 
We had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer. I confess - I coveted this new machine in a big way. So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop, it was very much like Christmas for me. My wife just smiled, and the kids gave out a sincere, "Whoa, that's cool!" at our new kitchen friend. Everything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel. The coffee just tastes good, first and foremost. I've tasted cups from other single-serve brewers, and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop-the-cup coffee. From my first experience with the Keurig machines, however, I was amazed how good the brew tasted. The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot, or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine's brew basket got finicky. The additional My K-cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans, too - so as a coffee snob, I'm hooked. The Platinum B70 adds selection for cup size - right now, I think our best default size is 9.25oz, filling out most travel mugs and our normal in-house mugs well without getting watery on the k-cups we've tried so far. And it has a larger reservoir for water, meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink. All of these things would be enough, right? But wow, it is just so cool looking. The blue LED lights that make the water glow on the left, and the blue LCD screen on the right that shows the clock, menu, cup selection, and the chrome fixtures - even the spring-loaded holder in the front top of the brewer - all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee, taking us into the realm of a really cool experience. The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen, seeing Daddy's glowing blue coffee brewer, just wanting to marvel in its glow.... okay, that's a little too melodramatic, but only slightly. If you like coffee and spend more than $10 per day, or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning, or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste - I think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out. Not just in the store, but blue and glowing in your own kitchen. Trust me - "Merry Christmas" is a great feeling 
Upon opening the box I found that the information given in the buying information for this product did not reflect the actural product. For one thing it only fits unright WindTunnel models that use bags. This hose is for models beginning with U53, U54 and U64 only 
This is my first food processor and I am thrilled with my Cuisinart. It is a perfect size for my needs and very easy to use. 
This set has 29 tips, a flower nail and one coupler in a plastic case. All the tips and more to decorate just about any cake you would make. 
The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl. A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together). The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. It's the kind with the rotating hub (two hub sizes are included, one for lemons and a larger one for oranges, etc). While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying. The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. At first I was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options, but after thinking about it, you only need the provided On, Off and Pulse. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it again from Amazon? Again, absolutely. The transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised 
I know that purists don't like serrated knives, but these are great! The weight of these knives is perfect--they feel like very expensive utensils. The chef's knife is rarely out of my hand, and the block makes the whole set very handy 
I ordered this stupid thing one month ago and they delayed multiple times and kept saying delay. These things will never come. So never expect cheap things from Amazon although they tried very hard to convince you to wait. 
I bought this coffee maker, because some people gave it high recommendation here. I think I wasted my money. It worked only for a couple of days. Finally, it just stopped working and I had to push the button at least three times in order to collect a small cup of coffee. That is ridiculous for an expensive coffee maker priced at $80 above. It makes me feel that this Japanese coffee maker is like Sony-made products, having a fancy looking but lousy quality. Save your money for some other coffe makers, and avoid this one 
Having now owned this device for three months, I found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there isn't any or no way to get any. Its lightweight, very portable and compact. While listed as a coffee maker, it brewed very slowly and not all that well. But as a hot water heater, it served fantastically well. The typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4-5 minutes, so little patience is needed. The device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses. There's an automatic shut off, the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold. It also come with a small spoon. Machine often come on by itself even before you hit the "on" button, probably if you hit the button before you plug it in. I would recommended that you have everything set up before hand. I used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size. The following products could be considered as tailored made for this device: Lipton Cup a Soup (sheer perfect for this machine), General Food International coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands. It also great for tea bags as well. I am not sure about brewing tea though. Overall, this device come highly recommended for anyone who might like to have a hot drink when there's none available 
I bought this on 8/4/06. When I first got the coffee maker, I ran plain water through the machine to get the plastic smell out. Afterwards, the machine still smelled like plastic, now I've ran vinegar through the machine and still no help. The horrible plastic smell is still there. Baking soda is no use also. The only thing I've not used is bleach. If you don't mind the plastic smell then this is a good small machine that works well with most coffee cups. Makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems 
Like many homemakers, I generally leave fixture installation to the man of the house. My husband refused to drill into our metal doors in order to install conventional curtain rods. I went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing. These magnetic curtain rods solved that problem. The rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts. The holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door. The curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains. I installed the set in a moment's time with very little effort. My husband was surprised and thrilled that I found a way to hang curtains without marring the metal surface of the door. 
I bought a dozen of these from another retailer (at half price) and I love them! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container. I use the cups to beat two eggs, melt butter, heat up baby food (never heat food in any plastic), to serve ketchup or other condiments, store a small amount of leftovers, etc. By using the appropriately sized cup, I save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher. I recommend these highly 
the quality of this set is very good. they are useful when you eat crabs.at first i thought maybe it was hard to clean them,but i was wrong. they are easy to use and easy to clean.sometimes i also use the clip to crash the nuts. it works great 
This tablemate is perfect for anybody.It has many uses around the house which i could list but it would take to long. It is sturdy enough to hold about 20 to 30 lbs.when the tray is at its level position. The 3 positions is a plus because it gives you more options.The one thing that is a negative is the legs do not fold down completely for storage but everything else folds down(table top and the small bar.other than the legs not folding this is a five star 
When my sons cordless died he went an bought this phone system for himself so that he could keep one in his room and another in his office (located in separate areas of the home). after he let it charge overnight we tested it out and were ammazed with it it could work inside outside all the way to the mailbox with no/little static!!! It was/is amazing. We contacted VTech they offer a very similar model for people with multilines/mailboxes and has the capability to add 7 hand sets--which is great since we all have seperated lines and sep. mailboxes 
Until I purchased this meat grinder, I was grinding with a manual one. It was a chore to set up and clean up. The Pro MG-800 Professional Meat Grinder made the grinding easy. It does not have to be clamped on the table. Ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath. Easy clean up, fast speed, three blades interchangeable for the grinding. I am totally happy with the product I purchased. Also, on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing. The advantage of having a grinder is I can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat 
I loved this when I purchased it, then I noticed it did not do a perfect job, then it would take a while to get going, then it smoked and died. Not worth it 
I've owned electric skillets before and it was always so difficult to clean up that we put them away and only pulled them out for big occasions. We bought this skillet a month ago and use it several times a week. We haven't had any problems with it at all, and we love the way you can pull the pan off for easy clean up 
This listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the Ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes Corelle has recently released. This is fabulous because I was concerned that the old Corelle I remember is a bit thin. These carry a 5-year warranty vs. the regular 3-yr. This pattern is more beautiful in person; the leaves have a great texture to them. The pattern is softer and less "limey" in person (in a good way). Don't shy away from Corelle because they aren't known for style (I almost did). The durability and beauty of these dishes are unmatched in my opinion. Purchased two sets for special occassion dinners and everyday use 
for the money this is a way for the novice cook to experience the quality of wustof. This knife went into my daughter in law's stocking for Christmas and was a great hit 
My husband has allergies to cat dander, and we have 4 indoor cats. We finally broke down and paid $500+ for this vacuum and replaced our old bag vacuum. I must say, this thing is AMAZING! I cannot say enough good things about this vacuum. The first time we used it in our living room, we emptied the canister 3 times! And I had just vacuumed with my old vacuum the day before.. It is amazing what this machine picks up that other vacuums leave behind. I could find no flaws with this product, other than it would be nice if it were cheaper. : 
I have several other silicone spatulas, and this Kitchenaid scraper is, by far, the worst I've used. Most silicone scrapers are soft and flexible, but this one is very stiff and rigid, so you cannot scrape containers out very well at all. Honestly, it doesn't even appear to be made of silicone. Cheap grocery store spatulas work much better than this one. Very disappointing 
On 8/15/06, I purchased and Irobot Roomba Scheduler. Within one month of purchase, it failed completely and would not work at all. On the Irobot website, it claims that their customer service department is open 24/7, and they guarantee a reply to an email within 24 hours. I sent an email, and I never heard anything back from them at all. After a week, I called their technical support line, and I waited on hold for 38 minutes before being able to speak to a technician, who swiftly determined that my unit was defective and needed to be replaced. I was told to mail in my defective unit and that another one would be shipped to me. It is now 11/9/2006 and I have received nothing and heard nothing from Irobot. DO NOT PURCHASE ONE OF THESE UNITS UNLESS THIS KIND OF PRODUCT UNRELIABILITY AND ABYSMAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS APPEALING TO YOU. 
Great invention! I drink mostly loose teas, gave up coffee some time ago. Because of work and being "Mom", I spend a lot of time in my car. I have tried several travel presses and most of them don't trap all of the leaves under the press, especially leaves that unroll as they steep. This is the most practical travel mug that I've ever seen and the storage compartment is absolutely great for carrying extra loose tea for those all day meetings. I ordered one for my desk and one for those long car trips 
I like the Calphalon Contemporary line a great deal, and so I was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan. But my first attempt to use it was a failure--the small steamer holes (and not very many of them) are easily covered by the food to be steamed, leaving the insert to function like a double boiler. After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it. I'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan, but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem 
I couldn't be more satisfied if my stock pot had cost 10 times as much 
The vacuvin wine chiller works as advertised and is a realy wine lover's aid when white wiine is desired but the bottle is not chilled. Using the vacuvin wine cooler within 5-10 minutes the wine is properly chilled. 
I found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill: 1.) Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids. Getting them out is a real pain, you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them. Just a mess. 2.) If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone. Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction. 3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself. I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously. Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating. I guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes. For me, I've decided to get one of those Vollcraft units. It's on order 
Wow! Finally a product that does what it claims to do; it filters water! Incroyable 
I had one many years ago and never had a problem. Good suction, maybe a little loud, but I don't care. I liked it so much I'm trying to get a new one. I don't recall ever having a problem with it like other reviewers have mentioned -- smoking, etc. It worked well and cleaned well 
I really like these pillows, they plump back up during the day when not being used. They are comfortable and hugable 
I am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so I bought this to make it at home. Making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions (I didn't watch the video). The frother even works well. The problem I had was with the flavor. The manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time, but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing. I had best results making just over one shot at a time, but the flavor was still burned and flat. In the end, I used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker 
I have several pieces of All Clad. I love this little bowl! It's great for mixing brownie's, eggs, pancakes....etc. I have other bowls, but, this is the one I reach for. You're buying with confidence when you purchase All Clad. The name speaks for itself, quality! You will not be disappointed 
This is a jewel. Takes the skin off nice and clean. Just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches. Just bought 6 more for family and friends. 
I bought a set recently and unfortunatley it is made in china. We have some older ones and they are much differen 
Fiestaware is timeless. Classic shape, classic colors, great quality. The finish is lead-free. The looks are from a bygone era but hold a charm that makes the transition to current styles. Great gift... can always be used. The only drawback I would say is the colors. Sometimes it is difficult to match colors to other brands of dishes you may already have 
I've owned Black and Decker's predecessor to this unit - the ShortCut - for about 25 years. It was a well designed Mini food processor. So I had high hopes for the Black Decker MFP200 MiniPro Plus Food Processor. What a disappointment! The problem is slicing. The slicing disk *MUST* be used in conjunction with a "redirection disk" that redirects whatever your slicing out the "ejection chute". Well this chute ejects alrighty - all over the kitchen. It goes back to Target tomorrow. And to the design folks over at B D: you should really test out your designs before going to production with them. Do yourself a *HUGE* favor and pass on this unit. I have to go now; I have mushroom slices all over my kitchen. 
If you like scrapping food out of the bottom of a frying pan then this is the one to buy! Adding oil or cooking sprays did not help, even bacon slices stick to this pan! I finally gave up and purchased a professional non stick frying pan and love it. This pan is going in my next garage sale 
I purchased 5 of these dishes (at $9.99 each) to give as Christmas gifts. Spode is manufactured in England, but the sub-standard knock-offs I received came from China. The color is dull and grayish. Return shipping would be outrageous, so I'm stuck with 5 ugly dishes. 
This item was ordered 1/4/06 it is now 2/25/06 and has not yet been shipped. Hard to rate the item, but for sure you can see the rating for delivery 
Farberware classic is great -- an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots pans. Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell. The newer pots pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom. So, their quality is less than it was; most people who "grew up with Farberware" may not realize this. Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers. Also note: if you are buying a 12" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section. I found it to be so absolutely huge -- you could fry a dozen onions in this monster -- that I simply never use it. The 10" and 8" sizes may be what you're looking for 
I have a dead knife. This is a dangerous knife. As I was cutting something the handle and knife broke. I was only cutting cheese. This should not happen with a good knife. I loved it until it almost caused me major damage. So be careful with this one 
I ordered this when it way below thirty bucks; a great deal for a workhorse of a fan. In the heat of the last month, it's been going almost 24 hours a day, and it's not slowed down or stopped yet. It's a bit noisier than the Vornado I have in the bedroom, but on the other hand, it's a stronger fan. I watch television in the same room, and don't have any problem, so unless you're extremely sensitive to sound, it's fine. Be careful moving it around; The "head" of the fan tends to come off the base if you aren't paying attention. It locks in place when you put it down, but moving it seems to make it "unlock." 
This is a premier baking sheet at a fraction of the cost. Made of commercial grade materials, it delivers quality nearly every time. I have made many different foods on these sheets, including fish sticks, cookies, meats and roasted potatoes. It works great with everyone, and there is no transfer ever. Browning is even and consistent, and I personally haven't yet had one warp at high temps and I have 4 of them. They are a standard size, and could be too big for some small ovens. I ran into this when I needed to visit a friend's home and do baking, and they didn't fit into her wall oven. Not really Chicago Metallic's fault, just something to watch out for 
Fiestaware ROCKS. A few years back, I started my Fiestaware collection. The butter dish, in turquoise, was a recent addition. I like the vibrant colors available which allow for a cheerful, eclectic mix or a more coordinated theme. It is of the highest quality and very durable in the oven as well. I am going to put glass doors on my cabinets to showcase my Fiestaware because not only is it practical and beautiful, they are individual pieces of art! 
I bought this back in 1999, and I love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks, but it's not built to last. First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on. It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the "feet" back on and the knob, they broke again right away. Cleaning is a pain, and the non-stick stuff got scraped right off. The food tray that goes on top is hard to clean too. Don't try to cook burgers in the basket, because they shrink as the fat drips out, no matter how tight you make the basket, and they start sliding around and falling apart as they hit each other. Cooking times were always longer than the cookbook says. I used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they're so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs. I still use it, but I wouldn't buy a 2nd one after reading all the reviews. I think I'll try a George Foreman one next time 
The temperature readings were spot on. There are multiple ways to display it, hang it from the shelves in your oven, place it on the bottom of your oven. it's very stable, doesn't fall over, mostly because of it's 4 inch length. BUT... as with all things in the oven, this will become splattered with grease, and harder to read, and you'll want to wash it....DON'T! any type of cleaning, be it abrasive , or chemical, such as Simple Green, will erase the temperature markings... and make it useless 
I bought this with a lot of expectations hoping to cook indoor healthy grilled meats during winter. As soon as I saw the pan I was a little disappointed with the ridges. They are deep (which is good) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos. So your meats will be less brown. After rubbing it with a litlle oil before cooking I set out to make my first set of turkey burgers. Now the way I make my burgers is by adding some chopped onions, garlic, and green chillies to the ground meat. That is where the pan gave problems. The meat cooked ok but the small pieces of chopped onions, garlic, and chillies that fell out of the patties got burnt very fast and stuck to the pan making it difficult to clean. I spent about 20 mins cleaning each time. For cooking meat that is seasoned only this pan may be ok. For me it is sitting in the closet after two tries. I did not return it because the shipping costs would have made returning it too expensive in itself. Update (12/18/2004) I bought a Hamilton Beach 31603 Electric grill for around $20 which is tremendous. It is non-stick, dish-washer compatible and cooks great. 
I have this scraper and after just a few uses, it fell apart at the connection in the center. Normally, I rave about KitchenAid, but this product was truly a disappointment 
This product is junk. I like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed. The hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight. My second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! 
Like the other reviewers, I have a cat who previously showed little to no interest in cat items - until I put this out. It's now his regular spot to nap, and lounge. 
This is an extremely nice cutting board, great size and easy to handle. Cleans up in a breeze. No stains and does not dull those favorite knives. I have the larger size but this one is my favorite 
These were not from the pattern I have, but matched perfectly to my pattern which has been retired (Italian Vine) - but they are very large...which is okay if that is what you want. I do love them and they are fine quality 
we just bought a new house, and not only is our bedroom the coldest room, we also painted it a blue/grey. My husband did not want to part ways with our old comforter, even though it didn't match the walls. This duvet cover was the PERFECT solution. It is extremely soft and warm, and the "Windstream" colored snowflakes match our walls perfectly. I may even keep in on the bed in the summer when we have the A/C going in the room 
I bought the Back to Basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos. I was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke. It is made of plastic and apparently could not withstand the tension on the plug. I was very disappointed since I use it every morning but thought it would last longer. I will look for a better quality one next time 
This kettle has so many design flaws I don't know where to start. It doesn't whistle when it boils so if you leave the room you could have serious overflow before you get back. The spout is at such a steep angle that it often pours beyond the cup. The shape (especially the angle) of the handle means that it gets very hot -- I can't hold it without a pot holder -- and your hand gets scalded by the steam when you pour the water. Mine also already started rust on the outside. I purchased this kettle about six months ago and I'm going to have to now buy another one 
Heavy duty and scratch resistant (my husband always tests this with his house key). Good value for the money 
Cast iron is the only way to go when you are cooking on anything over 30,000 BTUs. Lodge has a lock on this market. Trouble with this wok is the sides are not high enough. As soon as you start mixing, your food goes sliding up and over the side. Also, for the extreme weight, the handle should be wider; distributing the weight a little more broadly for the weak hand hold. I gave mine away after three months. I wish they would change the design; I'd buy three 
I like the solid construction but I also like strong coffee. This machine does not "spray the entire filter basket". Instead, water dribbles out of a 2-inch diameter ring, leaving dry grounds at the end of the brew cycle. I sent the first one back. The replacement does the same thing. KitchenAid customer service confirms that, despite the discription on Amazon, the unit does not spray the entire filter basket. I'm sending the replacement back also. If you love strong coffee, don't buy this machine 
Less than one month after puchasing this pasta machine all of the pasta dies have broken. The ring nuts cannot hold the dies in place and they break. Maybe it is because I was making semolina pasta, but that should not be the case. This machine has caused me way too much stress at dinner time. Knowing what I know now I would buy fresh pasta at the store 
I would never buy this product again. The finish came off almost immediately. Don't waste your money 
This model is an improvement over the older pot shape. It is easier to clean and use. I wish it was available in local stores. I had to order it online which means extra for shipping 
Both pads "burned" on the backside the first time I used them. They are still serviceable, but the "burned" areas are hard. They were used in a normal kitchen--no blow torches 
hands down the best non-stick tongs I've ever purchased. Definitely worth the money! 
I love Vornado products but this doesn't qualify. Very little breeze. You have to turn the fan around to turn it off which means that about half the time I get whacked by the cloth blades. It should have a power switch on the cord instead. It's a trendy gadget that will only please people who are not Vornado customers 
I bought this rack thinking that I can now bake cakes with bigger size, or cool a bunch of cookies on the same rack; well...I am very disappointed. But let's start witht he good things first. PROS: 1. It's big, I like the size a lot 2. It's gridded, so I don't need to worry about cookies falling off the rack. They are steady right there. CONS: The biggest problem is the material, it is not strong at all! When the rack arrived, the middle of it was already bent (or sagging a bit). I was able to bent it backwards easily, yet that "perfect" posture didn't hold for long, it's back to its bad sagging position again very soon. Then it got way worse, when I try to cool cakes on it. Cookies aren't that bad, since they are light. When I have the moist and right out of the oven cake sitting on that rack, the middle of the rack is barely touching my kitchen counter top already. Of course, as soon as I lift my cake up, it goes back to the normal sagging position. I think unless you are planning on baking cookies only...this is not a rack for you. Pick something else, something stronger 
Although I love the patterns and heft of my 2 collections of stoneware, I got very tired of having them chipped and broken by the less "careful" members of my family. Although I've had two sets of Corelle before, and never had any problems with it, I never saw patterns that I could live with for very long. I've gone back to Corelle, and I think this is it for me. True, the plates are very light, but they are so damage resistant--and I can use this pattern for any season 
I've had this model of the Shark for a couple of months now and it is working great. It has a powerful suction compared to my Duster Buster. I have had no problems with the battery so far and it seems to last the adertised 15 minutes. I too concerned over the HEPA filters. You can do a decent job cleaning it and I plan to clean it well with my ShopVac to extend the life. The vacuum and accessories fit nicely into the stand. I would definitely recommend this product for quick vaccums around the house and in the car 
I bought this as a birthday gift to myself and I love it. I thought I would miss being able to preset my coffee timer at night to wake up to coffee, but this makes it so quickly that has not been a factor. The taste is unbeatable! Even if you leave the warmer on the entire morning the coffee never tastes bitter. Highly Recommended for coffee lovers! 
I LOVE this set. This was the first "real" cookware I've ever bought. My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set. We've had it now for about 2 months and I can't express how much we've enjoyed it. I've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on, but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick, it is. It's not! Think of it like this: It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick (maybe even better!). We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn't get over how uncomfortable the handles were. Since I haven't cooked with All Clad, I can't compare the Calphalon One to it, but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly. Clean up is SUPER easy! Just this morning I made bacon and french toast. I looked at the pans and thought "There is no way I'll ever get this clean!" I poured some Bar Keeper's friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless! Fantastic 
I've owned a couple of sets of Corelle dinnerware through the years and gave both sets away because I used them so long (without breaking any pieces) that I grew tired of the pattern. This time I decided I wanted a plain white dinnerwear set for everyday use. When I did an Internet search, this Corelle set came up. I bought it, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it 
I tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work. 
loved this grill, unfortunately we have only limited counter space otherwise I will put this grill permanently in the counter. My husband loves the burgers that I made from this grill. They lean and delicious!!! recommended it to anyone 
We purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house. At 14, he is the oldest of 5 - all indoors. We put it on the bed (his favorite daytime nap spot). He loves it, but so do the other four. They all try to squeeze in on it, with him, or take it over when he gets up. It's never empty! It has a bit of a "crinkly" noise but they don't seem to mind it after they try it. It seems to work great and very easy to keep clean. The patterned side can be de-furred with a few quick swipes of your hand, following the direction of the fabric nap. Good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats 
I am buying a replacement that I had for 15 years. It still works but the light went off. I never thought they were still making it. I tried recently 2 other brands that did not make it 1 month paid around $25. I gave up, I was still using my old Westclck until today when I found this one on Amazon. 
I myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot, I will agree with other reviewers, this Delonghi is Dewrongi. My husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing. If he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low. Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done. (We are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months. So after reading the other reviews, I'm no longer pursuing a replacement carafe but instead will buy him a whole new machine...and it won't be a Delonghi 
I received this set as a wedding present and have loved using it over the past 4 months. I cook several times a week, mostly for husband and myself, and sometimes for guests. This set has been perfect for my needs, and has performed very well. I follow the care directions (handwashing, no metal utensils) and the non-stick coating has done very well. I love the glass lids and the cushy handles. The set includes, as pictured, 1-, 2-, and 3-quart covered saucepans, 6-quart covered stockpot, and 8- and 10-inch French skillets. The skillets don't come with lids, but the two biggest pot lids work well. NOTE: The product descriptions mention an 11-inch saute pan; this is NOT in my set and is not included according to product features listing or the picture shown. I did feel a need to buy a 12-inch skillet as the one addition to supplement this set. 
The pitcher does what it's supposed to do and is easy to clean. My only wish is that they would make a pitcher like this microwavable and with lines showing the ounces of the contents. That way you could pour the amount you need and pre-warm the milk in the pitcher prior to frothing, achieving better faster more convenient results 
I learned a long time ago, if you go KitchenAid, you go for life. They make the highest quality, longest life products I have ever seen. This hand mixer is the third of its kind I've owned. I've had two of the Braun models and they died out after about a year of average use. I finally got the KitchenAid and it has been going strong for a few years now. I really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot, a full 8". Even though it is of substantial weight, it fits your hand like a glove. I found it far superior to the Braun, as a matter of fact, it doesn't even compare. The plastic cup with lid makes an excellent accessory since you can mix and store without wasting time. The chopper is the most efficient I have seen, does a better job that a food processor. I especially like the multi-speed dial. It goes from 1 to 9 so it has the power you need, when you need it. Egg white or whip cream doesn't even challenge it, the whipping attachment makes sure of that. This baby handles like a pro. There are times when you don't need the big mixer and the immersion blender really fills in nicely. You won't be disappointed with the quality, power or its sleek look 
These sheets are not quality. They are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them. The jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior. They are NOT a bargain 
I was thinking of buying parchment paper before this product caught my eyes. I took a chance after reviewing others' good reviews on it. And it was a good buy. I used it to bake and it's totally non-stick. It's also very easy to clean after use. If it can be used 5000 times as it claims, I definitely will save a lot compared to buying parchment paper 
This size is perfect for actually using. It gets thrown into the dishwasher and gets used every day. Love it 
When I received my set of Mini Springform pans I was very excited. I couldn't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts. And as expected the results were great. Only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves. Not only did I notice rust on the release hinges, but the rims on the collars were warped. At first I thought I could live with this, but a friend pointed out it could only get worse. I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade. Admitedly the results of my first time use were great, but I just don't feel these pans will last. I hate buying something and knowing I will have to replace it soon. And that is exactly the way I felt with these pans 
I have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn't work. Can't turn it off and it doesn't cycle when the dog barks. I called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don't support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT" 
I ended up giving it to Salvation Army. Takes more than one cake mix. More like 1 and a half to fill it up. I didn't think it was worth the money. 
I bought this teapot from Amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times. The material is great, heat retention is good, it looks very nice, and I had no problems cleaning it (I use a babybottle brush). The tea infuser is not very effective though. The holes are a bit on the large side, so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through. And the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves, especially when I'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim (it doesn't extend deep enough). So I don't use it at all (I put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as I pour). However, my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour. So you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours, ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter. I have to make sure I either wipe the spout in between pours, or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin (unless I'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session). I found that pretty annoying. So in conclusion, for the price I paid for this teapot's supposedly wonderful features, I don't think it was a good buy. 
This item was ordered to replace a Kitchen Aid unit used extensively for a number of years. I am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients. I first heard of the DeLonghi Mixer when it was branded Kenwood -in an Australian magazine. What a nice difference! The Kitchen Aid now appears to be so antiquated by comparison!! I love the very practical easy to clean design and construction of the DeLonghi as well as the physical ability of the unit to mix more content in a more complete manner. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product. 
We raved about making panini's. Introduced many of our friends to them. Then it died without warning in the middle of dinner. We paid $80 for the thing too 
The clock is attractive, well-made, easy to mount and a good buy for the money 
The cuisinart griddler has proved to be a very handy appliance in my kitchen. It's various heat settings which are accurate is very helpful in perfect results for various tasks. We have become addicted to panini! They come out perfectly. Steaks are done to perfection! I have not used the griddle as much, but when I have the results are great. 
I got this on sale from Targets for $35. Eagerly I plugged in the unit, turned the variable dial to maximum steam, and increased the digital dial to 7. And then I waited, and waited, and waited, for 10 minutes. The iron never warmed up, let alone hot enough to iron anything. I can't say this is a bad product, but surely I got a non-working unit 
Terrible ergonomics! It was SO difficult and uncomfortable to keep the trigger engaged and carve at the same time. My hand was ACHING by the time I'd carved the brisket. I've never used a more awkward or uncomfortable appliance 
This grill is better in theory than practice. I'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really isn't practical for steaks except very thin ones. It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches. I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else. It is easy to clean, so that's a plus 
For fifteen years I've talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one. He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring, then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov. I've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk don't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further. I can't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position... to scape or to add ingredients. I like to make crepes, which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating. It's impossible with this machine. I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl, unmixed... and the batter is full of lumps. If I want to scape the bowl, (which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk doesn't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time, and even then, with the paddle or whisk attached, it's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back. You can't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely. You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand. This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver. It's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter. The speeds are not variable enough. It seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out. It's a monumental disappointment and I'm frustrated because it's been so long since he bought it, I can't imagine they would allow it to be returned. So, I still mix everything by hand or use my stick mixer and feel crumby about the big white doorstop taking up counter space 
I purchased this knife because my daughter didn't like using any of my knives; she wanted one like the chefs all use on Food Network. I wasn't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise, and I'm pleased with it. It's nice-looking, feels comfortable to hold, works well for chopping vegetables. Overall, a decent knife at a very reasonable price. 
I got this pan for making cheesecakes in a 5 quart round crock pot. (There are recipes for these on southernfood.about.com in the crock pot section.) This a good pan for this type of recipe! It's an unusual size, more than mini but less than full size. It's a great size for one or two people. (Standard recipes and pan sizes always make waaaaay too much for the small household.) I generally like Kaiser products. Very good German engineered quality! The BMW of bakeware. No leaks, excellent materials, spring is excellent. I had some other springform pans that were useless and they went into the trash. Not so Kaiser. Kaiser pans are keepers! They are worth the little bit of extra money compared to other brands. America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated also endorses Kaiser as the best springform pan choice...and they really know how to evaluate and test equipment and cookware 
This attachment vibrates so badly that it about bounces the food processor right off the counter. I love the food processor but I regret having bought the juice extractor 
This is one great tool. I have this as well as the scoop and they are both great items. I like the spade better since I LOVE ice cream and it makes it easier to fill the bowl quicker. The style is great and the functionality is superb. Now that Kitchenaid is making tools and gadgets, I am finding myself getting all new sorts of items I never knew I wanted or needed. I'm even replacing other brands of tools with Kitchenaid ones 
This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple. Sitting on my kitchen countertop, it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning; glowing, shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting. Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple 
We wanted to rid our kitchen of the microwave for health reasons but still have a fast way to get hot water. I never dreamed any small appliance could be this great. Water comes to a rolling boil far faster than the microwave was ever able to do. We liked this so well we bought a second one for the lower level of our home 
Stainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best 
I Love this pan and Size. I wasn't going to buy this pan at first, cause it was the "Simply", But I'm not sorry at all... I have alot of Calphalon Commercial (at least 20), and yes it's thicker, But I think this cooks very well. Being that this is abit lighter, I find when its filled up, its heavy enough for me, and easyier to handle. The price is also alot less then the Calphalon Commercial. Since you most likely would not use this pan everyday, I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way. I have sauted hamburger meat,onions, peppers ect. emptyed the fat off, added sauses, and continued cooking everything together, then puting this into the oven to finish it off.. Never a problem. I have used this for making Large Egg Omelets, the cheese has never stuck. Use it for fryed potatoes with low fat cheese, and I don't need to use alot of oil, The nonstick works fine. I have used this for sauteing Pasta with sauses.. This is a large size, so you can put alot into this and have left overs. You can make pancakes, frenched toast, I would think anything you want.. I guess what I'm saying is, you can use this size for anything. I do have the Calphalon Commercial double gridle, but if you don't have room for all the peices that I have, this can cover alot. I have found this to cook even, and you don't need to turn your stove on high. This lid seems to fit fine, and its a bit domed. I don't have a problem with it. The sides are stright up, and seems high enough. Lots of flat space in the bottom. Mine is also made in Ohio, not Japan, but you never know with some peices of Calphalon lately!! This washes very easy. Never put any Calphalon into the dishwasher, altho this lid you could put into the dishwasher ( I don't tho) I would buy this again...I only paid $42.00 for this, so I did buy two of them, one for a gift. I don't understand Amazon's priceing , as sometimes the Calphalon Commercial can be less money!! So I would say, take the time and check out your other options, as the Calphalon Commercial has more layers of nonstick and is a higher quality, but don't let that scare you off from buying this one 
After operating the Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain for a month my 2 cats won't go anywhere near it. Very disappointing! 
Great Product for a good price. All sent as ordered 
Just purchased this blender am returning it immediately. It has a number of terrible features: it's very difficult to remove the cover if you have carpal tunnel, arthritis, or weak hands. To change speeds you turn a dial (as opposed to the buttons on most others), which makes for rough transitions. Moreover, the dial feels very flimsy and I doubt this machine will last. I purchased this model because I thought its premium price would mean a premium product, but from the plastic gears to the flimsy dial, to the impossible-to-open cover, I hate it. Will go back to either an Oster or Waring, both of which served me well, each for over 10 years. 
These spoons are great. They are very sturdy and easy to use, and the finish on the metal is a nice touch. Overall, practical and attractive 
I totally agree with the previous reviewer. This pan is terrible. I also ended up with only tops. I suppose you could put paper muffin cups in, but what would be the point of buying this pan then??? Also, these do not nest like a regular metal pan (the sled takes up a lot of room). DO NOT BUY THIS 
This grinder has a small capacity [not as advertised]. If you follow directions, it will only grind enough for 4 cups at a time. Also, for some reason it generates a static charge and there is coffee dust all over the counter after emptying it. The cord is stiff and the cord storage is inconvienient. Finally, it is much more noisy than my old one 
Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of "design awards", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment. 
Read the reviews and ordered.... Don't regret it at all. Will be ordering more for gifts and myself. I have problems with my hands, but have not found the lids to be a problem AT ALL. Just start on one side and gently push your way around the lid...Goes right on, nice and snug. Can't comment on the breaking issue. Just hasn't happened. Maybe if item is dropped immediately after removing from the freezer?????? But, under normal conditions, I've had no problems. Crystal clear, easy to clean, stacks just fine. Don't regret my purchase and as stated, will be getting additional sets. 
Given as a gift - same story: The fact that I primarily used high heat, it didn't last past 6 months. All-Clad said too bad after I emailed them, and called them several times leaving messages - took them 3 months to get back to me, and then that was it. I WILL NEVER BUY ALL-CLAD EVER AGAIN!! 
I saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one. That was several years ago. Finally, our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky. So, I promptly bought another one. Morning is just not the same without our brewstation 
We registered for a set of 10 WMF utensils for our wedding. They look great hanging in our kitchen and most all of the utensils are very functional. However, we are now on our second scooper and it has broken now for the second time. Its just not sturdy enough for its intended use...ice cream 
We have had braun coffee pots for several years and have been happy with the coffee maker. Unfortunately, the two coffee makers that we had ordered from Amazon had a persistent leaking problem unlike the exact same models that we have had in the past 
After 3 months of average use, this vaccuum stopped spinning the brushes. The canister is difficult to empty. I was very dissappointed because of the failure of this machine to last. I will never buy a hoover product again 
At $20 and free shipping this is probably the best deal around for people on a buget. Realistly the retail value is not $80 it is around $40. The fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great. If the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money don't complain about it when it's plainly listed. An easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer. The only reason I deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy. It feels like it would tear very easily. This is not a problem for me as I find them annoying but may bother some people. All in all I think it is a great deal 
I ordered 3 (2x) sets of these so that I would have a full complement of 6 cookie sheets. When they arrived, I noted that they were a bit lighter than the commercial quality cookie sheets that I had used previously, but my thinking was that if they baked well, that was all that counted. I always bake with an Exopat silicone mat on my sheets. Upon the first use, when they were placed in the oven, the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin. The next thing I heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven. Lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees F translates to poor heat conduction, and burned cookie bottoms. This symphony of metal buckling, courtesy of my new $15 cookie sheets. Even with the Exopat silicone sheets on them, the cookies were barely done when I decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap, thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to "double pan" to prevent burning. What a wonderful situation Amazon has presented me with - $90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets. Yes, into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly, its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work-arounds to augment their performance. These are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they're worse - with the price-point of supermarket wares, one can infer the quality that one is getting. I used to believe brands like Calphalon stood for quality, and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of, at least, mezzanine quality. When I buy on the web and cannot better scrutinize the items I'm choosing, I tend to favor trusted brands. As it turns out, these sheets did not have the Calphalon name on them anywhere - Calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -Made in China- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the Calphalon brand. With the holiday baking season upon us, what do I plan to replace them with? The Vollrath cookie sheets (not non-stick, but I use silicone mats, so do I care?) recommended in Cooks Illustrated magazine. They're in stock at Chef Resource - their price everywhere is $19 but most vendors are out of them. They're due to arrive via UPS day after tomorrow - Tuesday, 10/17. Holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of Calphalon, apparently. If I could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash, I would so rate them. 
I have to agree with the other negative reviews. This insert loosely fits the All-Clad 3-Quart Casserole Pan I bought with it (which I could understand if I were trying to use it with another brand). It being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked. As with all All-Clad products it's built very well but who cares about that if it doesn't work properly. Someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert, it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well. I think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam wasn't rolling out from in between the insert and pan. It works, just not very well. 
I have had this for almost a year, and for the money I cannot recommend a better product. I would buy another 
I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk. I have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job. All of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom. So, you have to keep stirring and stirring and stirring the mixture to get it all incorporated. And then try adding the crushed ice. This blender is going back. If you need a blender to make smoothies, this is not the model to buy 
I accidentally ruined my father's old baking stone so I bought this on for him to replace it. Everything sticks to it! We thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking. We've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it. That's not even the worst of it. It puts out a disgusting smell in the oven. Just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing. I definitely DO NOT recommend this item. 
I'm not sure who decided to put the word non-stick in the title of this griddle. It took me two days to scrape off the egg omelet that I tried to cook on it the first time. They should change the title of this item to Calphalon One Stick 10-Inch International Griddle. Do not buy unless you enjoy hand cleaning and scraping pots and pans 
Farberware 18/10 stainless steel cookware is a good line. I had this cookware at one time, and I can recommend it, especially for use on gas burners. Unlike Calphalon cookware, it can go in the dishwasher. However, to keep the finish gleaming, you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads. The 8-Quart Stockpot with Lid is a kitchen essential 
We had a Krups for about 4 years at the office and the coffee was good. We needed to replace it because the Carafe broke and there was no replacement available (they discontinued the model and the carafe - thanks Krups). So, we replaced it with the FM4. I didn't like the coffee from the start - but I figured it would get better. Two weeks later, I dumped it for a Bunn B10-B which got good ratings here. Get the Bunn - it makes a good cup of coffee. We always use Starbuck's coffee 
What I like: quantity of beans you can grind before dumping the container, ease of operation What I don't like: Sort of messy, but this just comes with the whole process of grinding, regardless of brand, hole that ground beans comes out needs cleaning every time Overall this grinder has been a good buy and I have enjoyed it so much more than my old blade grinder. 
Purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another 
Its a traditional serveware for serving the soup course The color of the tureen set allows it to be used with many of the dinnerwares the size is adequate to serve at least 8-10 people.The under plate is something not found with usual tureen sets which gives it an elegant look but it appears a little overpriced 
When it worked it worked well. However, eight months into this -- and I only have used it maybe 6 or 8 times, it's broken. I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up. I can see a line here and there, but nothing else. Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information. It is defintely NOT worth $30 
Great little item and we use it every week. Wonderful with non-stick surfaces. I want another one 
I bought it for my Fiance and she loves it. It's great for frying chicken 
I had the same wok for four of the five years that I lived in China. It was made of the same type of carbon steel as this one. When I came back to the USA last year, I looked all around for this kind of wok and was very happy to find it. My wife, a native of southwestern China, joined me in the USA this year. She thoroughly approved of my choice. And, boy, does she make the best stir fried vegetables in the world. True, it is heavy, but that is good news because now we have an electric stove and the thick steel helps distribute the heat well. (In China we had a gas stove with a huge flame.) I still don't understand all the rituals involved with "seasoning." In China I was taught to scrub it hard after cooking with a stainless steel or brass scrubber in hot soapy water, then dry it very well before heating it just a little and rubbing it down with oil (we use a paper towel) on the inner surface. Store it oiled! Rarely have we had any sticking problems. A little scrubbing gets the rust right off if you forget to dry and oil, so don't panic! This is a fairly priced (at around $25), good piece of equipment for cooking "real" Chinse food 
I was at first very excited with my new Zyliss salad spinner - it looks great, and it's much easier to spin than the older string-pull version (not to mention the old-school "pump" versions, which required a lot of effort). However, as another reviewer mentions, it simply does not get your greens very dry. I've been surprised and disappointed by the amount of water left on lettuce after spinning, and spinning, and spinning 
The machine is easy to use and makes great espresso ... when it's working!Mine broke down within the first year. I spent $80 dollars to fix it the first time, but it broke down again after another two months of use (water wouldn't heat up). It would cost me another $200 to fix it. I'm now looking for a more reliable machine. 
Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me. I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight. If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons. Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly. Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries. This light is also extremely fragile. Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these! I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!) It is terrific! It has a clock with an alarm and a timer. You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes. At that time you can extend the minutes. If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off. It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light 
Amazon couldnt send me the correct cutting board and they tried 4 times and now they want me to review this item that they never sent m 
So far this has been a great product. I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea. So far it has held up great. This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it. I have never used this item to store anything else other than water; but in theory, you should be able to make tea or coffe the night before and still have it hot in the morning 6 to 8 hours later, assuming the liquid is boiling when you pour it in. Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature. 
Bought this grinder after my Capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing. After using for about two weeks, I have to agree with other reviews that mention "static problem". The grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine. The plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off. I would not recommend this grinder 
I have seen this set at my friends place ....its gorgeous!! A bid pricy though compared to other corelle sets 
Love this cake plate. Looks like our retro 50s kitchen. Its solid, well-formed glass with fluting on the base, a nice touch. And you can't beat the price. Our dinner guests are always excited about desert when they see it displayed so adoringly. I can't think of a single thing bad about it. Well, maybe the cleaning part 
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back. The picture looks cool but it's deceiving. The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left. It couldn't keep the right time 
I bought this pan as a Christmas gift for my husband. It would have been easier if I had just put a match to my money and burned it. He has given up using this pan. He even read the directions thinking he was doing something wrong. Every egg he placed in it stuck to the side of the teflon rings. What a shame. The only use would be to throw the rings away and just use it as a regular pan. Don't waste your money 
The Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made. In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely. Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat. Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily. The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter). After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up. I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray. The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time
