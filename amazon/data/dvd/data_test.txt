Not my type of humor. I think I'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining 
This comedy starring (Martin Short), and (Kurt Russell) is pretty funny. When I first watched it, I wasn't really impressed with it, but now I find it pretty funny. I think that (Kurt Russell), as Captain Ron was pretty funny. However, it was the antics of (Martin Short), who hires Captain Ron to sail his ship in the Caribbean, that was the funniest character in the film. The story begins when a relative of (Short) dies, leaving him a ship, which is moored at a small Caribbean island. The wife (Mary Kay Place) who is not too pleased at going to the island, decides to go along with this mid-life crises of (Short); on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat. Enter Captain Ron (Kurt Russell). He is a very strange and quirky fellow, to the uptight and anxious (Martin Short). However, since (Short) knows nearly nothing about boating, he decides to hire Captain Ron on the suggestion and recommendation of the man who is interested in buying the boat. Therefore, Captain Ron, who is not very bright to begin with, leads the family [including Short's two children] on a cruise through the Caribbean: And he is a very eccentric character. Harmless, but funny. What ensues is a funny interaction between (Short) and (Russell) on their voyage. Including a scene where (Russell) warns (Short) not to stray from one particular islands path, due to Guerilla's on the island. Which (Short) interpets as Gorilla's. A very funny scene. Recommended, it is a family watch that your children can enjoy 
A deeply emotional film about Addiction, Love, and Family just to some, but when you watch this film you take something with you , something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted, LIfe. Each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending, really depressing movie but worth a look at least once. Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly were extremely good but Ellen Burstyn broke my heart her performance Rocked 
Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by GM's unhealthy cost structure. The company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney UAW sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it. Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
My daughters are not Barbie doll fans...but they do like the movies. So do I. All but this one. The Pegasus were beautiful...but it stopped there. We thought Barbie was too snotty and disrepectful in her manner of speaking. Bring back the nice Barbie! Her 'boyfriend' was just as snotty. We didn't like the evil Wenlock...and the way he preys on teenage daughters forcing them into marriage. In one scene Wenlock throws a tray of food into one of his wives face. That was shocking and sad. Our copy of this dvd went into the trash 
ok even for a guy, I thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth, but to my amazement I thought is was a great story and lived up to all that I have reviewed. I would suggest the movie to all. 
My children (ages 6 and 11) absolutely love HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. My son's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring, and he's very excited about trying out for a part. I enjoyed watching it as well. The musical is set in a fairy tale high school, but what musical isn't a fairy tale? Puppy love and teen rivalry ... all done in a family-friendly Disney way. Walt would have been proud 
I have a little brother who is 7, and severely disabled,(He's on a 9 month old level) Not much catches his eye, but one day when he was throwing a tantrum, I put it on nick jr,and noticed he stopped crying when he heard the sound of the singing Backyardigans. He couldn't stop looking at the colorful animation.This show is a lifesaver! It kept him entertained for the whole 30min. I'd heard about the show from a friend,who has a 1 yr old who loves the show, and she told me to try it out. I took her advice and my brother loved it! And as soon as I saw it on VHS, I bought it.He loves "the snow fort", but his favorite is "the Yeti", He laughs the whole time the penguin sings "The Yeti Stomp". I also bought him "It great to be a ghost" DVD for christmas.I recommend this for any little children, it works like a charm.[^_^ 
Funny and very inspirational. Good way to encourage young teenagers to build self esteem. If there's a will, there's a way. Anyone can dance 
More than "male" and "female". More than your view or her view or my view or any one person's view of what makes "male" and what makes "female" and everything in between. Sexuality (gay, straight, bi, asexual, etc) is different than gender (male/female) and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other. There are gay men and straight me and bisexual men, too. Whatever they identify as has no impact on whether they are also transsexual and seek re-assignment into a body that fits them more. It's not some sick fetish or crazy delusion. Surgery, hormones, these are RISKY! And they would not be undertaken unless other options HAD been explored and found unable to cease the ache inside. Gender Identity Disorder (GID) is real. Transition (the process of taking hormones, living as the preferred gender in all things, surgery, etc) is not a CURE but it can make life bearable. And I think it's funny that still male to female transsexuals are regarded more often as "real" and the female to male transsexuals are ignored. Raci has known she was trans it appears most of her life. She started taking hormones while she was still in what should have been her male puberty. So, of COURSE she looks "more feminine" but that doesn't make her any more or less of a "real woman" than the other MTF, Gabbie. Gabbie is a lesbian while Raci is straight. See how this works? Gabbie likes women, Raci likes men. It has nothing to do with one being "right" and one being "wrong". There is a world of difference between a man relating to a woman and a woman relating to a woman. Just as a man relating to a man vs. a man relating to a woman. And it's not all sexual. It is entirely plausible that a man would transition into a woman and still be attracted to women. Hello, the gender changed, not who they were attracted to! I'm just so tired of seeing so many people picking apart transsexuals. We are not here for your amusement. We are not here to be some star in your porn show. We are real. And these kids do an amazing job showing that. But I see that the majority of reviewers are more wound up over the "sick fetishes" and one MTF being more female convincing than the other. I would love to see the same folks who brought us this (a more emotional struggle) to also do one documenting the physical changes that happen and how FTMs, in particular, struggle with the emotional effects of T. - Wil 
I bought this for my husband, because I knew he liked Seven Samurai. He was delighted with the gift, and I was surprised to find that I really like these movies too. They are entertaining and insightful and a pleasure to watch 
FALLING IN LOVE 1984 is One of my Favorite Romantic 80s Movies,I have two LASERDISC Copies One [NEW] And the other is [ USED ] And I have it on DVD too,You gotta give it a try you will love it too : 
This show is great. The 5th Season was considered so-so by critics but it is truely halarious. See 'The Ski Lift' for a classic Curb episode 
Maybe for some people, to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal, but in Matt Sullivan's case, it could be a total nightmare. After his girlfriend Nicole leaves him, Matt spends about six months devouring girls, until he starts to hallucinate. Advised by his brother, Matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems, and proposes to go through lent without sex. For Matt's friends, this odyssey is as absurd as impossible, and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last Matt's abstinence. He doesn't have it easy, as many temptations will make him suffer, and even smell the possibility of a new love. 40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character. In a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years, this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love. OH. WHAT A SHOCKING DISCOVERY! 
Gilbert Gottfried is a genius. THANK YOU for making a DVD that puts so many dirty jokes where they long--together! Of course I knew a few, but I learned so many more! Gilbert's delivery is priceless, and his impressions of comics like Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier. If you're a fan of filthy humor, this DVD is a MUST HAVE! My personal favorite is about the guy who doesn't know if his wife has VD or TB... And at $13.99...it's a steal. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE 
When I first watched this TV movie, with an unusal turn by Lucille Ball as a homeless woman, I was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role, and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished "bag lady". Although definitely within the "TV movie" league, this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy 
Although subtitled Grazia's island (Grazia is the lead role, magnificently realized by Valeria Golino), "Respiro" could have well been called "Scenes from rural Sicilian life", as the scenography, cinematography and tableaux-like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line. Respiro's locale is Lampedusa, a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta, this place is about as remote as it gets - Tunisia is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades; this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni, not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea, the children play, women pack fish, old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky. Throughout this film you would probably ask yourself, "Is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited?" It's a fairly typical story, the type that a few great (and many, many average) Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural, ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since "Cinema Paradiso?" What I like most about the movie, besides the appealing scenery, was the interrelations of the characters, the humor, petty gossips, the impromptu emotional outbursts, the displays of maternal and filial affection. The two boys are tremendous: the older Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) is the more mature of the two. The younger Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings, often without sense. His rant against the busybody women is a treasure, as is his little-brother-as-big-brother protectiveness of his sister from the policeman-friend. The boy embodies an epic Italianate inflammability far beyond his years. While viewing this I thought the son's affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times. They do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village. After seeing this film, I have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar, the differences are in the languages, but the feelings are same. I enjoyed this film so much I might see it a couple of times. 
Yet another amazing film from Paul Verhoeven with so much depth and weight I can't even tell you. Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do. Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role. Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films. So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric's tango towards the end, april fools day, vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.) See this as soon as possible. It would make a terrific double feature with the Young Lions 
Watching "Once and Again" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again. This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date. I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them. Watching "Once and Again: The Complete Second Season" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning. There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family ("Scribbling Rivalry"). Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again. If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through. If the first season of "Once and Again" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance. There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., "Scribbling Rivalry") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell ("Edifice Wrecked"), than there is about them being with each other. While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, "Feast or Famine"). The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well). So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing ("Best of Enemies"), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating ("Food for Thought"). Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on "thirtysomething" all over again. But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick ("Ozymandias 2.0"), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot. This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live. But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting ("Edifice Wrecked"), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison ("Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight"). When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious. This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters. Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun ("The Other End of the Telescope"), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby ("Forgive Us Out Trespasses"). Judy comes up with the great idea of "Booklovers," despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck. Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music ("I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down"), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue. Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December. I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation. So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation. My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental. At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring. The fact that season two ends with the wedding ("The Second Time Around") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking "Once and Again" was simply about Lily getting remarried. It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD 
This is the masterpiece of atheist Spanish film director Lu�s Bu�uel. An unrelentless, devastating, unmerciful criticism of religion. Yes, it can be viewed as a social satire, a political vehicle, etc. That's what makes it a great film, that you can view it from different perspectives. To me the most valuable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see, as in a wide canvass, the soul and mind of this great atheist man. It is revealing that Bu�uel took to the task of "proving" religion wrong and absurd with so intense passion and -I would even say- desperation. Because no one is more desperate than he who searches and can't find. But, as Unamuno would say to explain the angst of the author, it comes from seeking to believe with the reason and not with the life. The film depicts Spain's social condition pretty accurately in those mid-century years. Unamuno explains this aspect (though he wrote decades before Bu�uel's work) as follows: "In France and Spain there are multitudes who have proceeded from rejecting Popery to absolute atheism, because 'the fact is, that false and absurd doctrines, when exposed, have a natural tendency to beget scepticism in those who received them without reflection. None are so likely to believe too little as those who have begun by believing too much.'" Another important aspect of the film is the way he depicts the poor. Helplessly incorrigible, lacking as much in money as in human virtues, and extremely ugly and repealing. It is very curious how Bu�uel did not even allow any little space for sentimentality or candidness; I mean, there is no hero or anything even close to it. It's a terrible portrait of the human soul. I would say pessimistic, but I don't think Bu�uel would agree. He would probably prefer sincere or realistic. The symbolism is so evident that any private school kid could figure it out, so forcibly paired are the scenes with their objects of criticism. And trying to make it so evident (and not as difficult as other of his surrealistic films) evidences his intensity of feeling, his anger, his hatred of all that Bu�uel despises, religion. And not only Catholicism -it just happened to be Spain- but universal religion. Going back to the the poor in the film, Bu�uel being a communist sympathizer, it is ironic that he doesn't show even a little mercy with his poor. I think the rich young man is a more admirable figure than any of his other characters. The female protagonist, the nun who gives up her vows being used only as a tool, cannot be expected to represent all nuns or all religious persons -it would be preposterous-. A case that in real life might happen isolatedly should not be used to prove a general rule. It is dishonest. But there is a correlation between his view of the economically poor and the Christian view: "For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always." John 12:8 Isn't there something of the same nature? So how can one conception of the poor lead Christians to love them nevertheless (knowing that they will always be around), and the furious atheist/socialist to despise them (maybe not to condemn them, because surely "society or the rich" would take the blame). Well, that question is for everybody to meditate on. I wish people like Bu�uel would give Christ a chance. Unamuno, another great Spaniard, says: "Note the greater part of our atheists and you will see that they are atheists from a kind of rage, rage at not being able to believe that there is a God. They are the personal enemies of God." But -I say- how can you be an enemy of someone who does not exist? However, this is a great and splendid work of art. But now, ending with a quote from Rousseau: "Where is the philosopher who would not willingly deceive mankind for his own glory? With believers he is an atheist; with atheists he would be a believer. The essential thing is to think differently from others." Nevertheless, it moves! 
Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off. 
This is one bad movies. I am a devout horror fan, but I was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie. The acting is worse than bad, it's a joke. The plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous. Save your money. Even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive. There is no humor, no likable characters, not even a decent quote or one liner. by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion, you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back. So save yourself disappointment and keep looking, this movie is the biggest bomb, I have stumnbled across in years. 
Harvey Milk was the elected supervisor of District 6 in San Francisco when he was murdered--along with Mayor George Moscone on November 27, 1978, by fellow supervisor, Dan White (who later claimed the infamous "Twinkie defense"). The film "The Times of Harvey Milk" firmly places the murder of Milk, a gay politician, into the politically significant context of the times. The crime, the verdict, and the sentence served were all shocking. This film tells the story behind the headlines. Milk was a stockbroker on the East Coast, when he decided to pull up roots and head for San Francisco. He opened a camera shop on Castro Street and quickly earned the name of "Mayor of Castro Street" for his enthusiastic community involvement. His interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office, but when the city's elections ran by district--rather than citywide--Milk became the newly elected supervisor for the Sixth District. Milk's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall. The film includes photographs, newsreel footage, and many interviews with those who crossed Milk's path in a professional or personal capacity. Milk was passionate about public transportation, rent control, and the rights of seniors and gays. White, on the other hand, found San Francisco's Gay Day "obscene." Eerily, there are several photos of Milk that also include his killer--clean cut, ex-fireman and family man, Supervisor Dan White. The film explores the flavour of the times--San Francisco was becoming a gay Mecca, and there were some people who couldn't adjust to that fact. Senator John Briggs, who called San Francisco "the moral garbage dump of the nation" was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired. Milk fought this ballot tooth and nail, and it failed. The film "The Times of Harvey Milk" includes two discs. One disc contains the film, and the other disc is packed with extra features--including coverage of the film's premiere in Castro Street, a Dan White update, 1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime, director's commentary, the Academy Awards 1985, and a photo gallery. For those of us who remember the headlines, "The Times of Harvey Milk" is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time--displacedhuma 
With great music and a setting that reminds you of "Vampire Hunter D" it sucks you into watching the series. The plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing. The animation is good, which is a must have for me, but it wasn't enough to redeem the series 
I am a BBC devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic BBC storytelling and visual feasting. However, I was only partially correct. It is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly. I left the film feeling robbed, disappointed, sad, and a bit unfulfilled. I viewed it only once and then sold it on e-bay at a cut-rate price. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money 
I rented Terror Train (1980) with a friend of mine about ten years ago and I remember after we watched it we were both like "Is that it?" Not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time, but I decided to give it another chance, and you know what? I liked it...I really did...I'll grant you it's not an outstanding feature, but the effort is there, resulting in an overall solid film. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode (The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper, Turner Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies), the movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog, Trading Places, A Fish Called Wanda), who, a couple years earlier, had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called Halloween (1978). Also appearing is Ben Johnson (Hang 'Em High, Red Dawn), Hart Bochner (Breaking Away, Supergirl, Die Hard), Derek McKinnon (Breaking All the Rules), Sandee Currie (Terminal Choice), Timothy Webber (The Hotel New Hampshire), and David Copperfield, who was at one time engaged to supermodel Claudia Schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work, earning himself a place in the `What the f?' hall of fame. As the movie opens, it's New Year's Eve, and the boys at the Sigma Phi Omega house are having a party. After a prank directed at one of the spaz fraternity pledges goes horribly wrong, we fast forward three years and see another New Year's Eve bash in the offing, this time a costume affair taking place on an excursion train, hosted by Doc (Bochner) and Mo (Webber), two of the fraternity brothers responsible for the prank that occurred three years ago. Also in attendance is Alana (Curtis), Mo's girlfriend, who was also involved in the prank, but not to the extent to being fully aware of what exactly Doc and Mo had planned, resulting in some bad blood between her and Doc, who was essentially the ringleader (and a real a-hole, to boot). Anyway, turns out the nerdlinger who was the victim of the gag is now a dangerous, homicidal psychopath, has decided this a good opportunity to exact his revenge by sneaking on board the train and murdering all those who wrong him back in the day. Actually, it was a pretty good move because not only is most everyone disguised in costumes, but they're also stoned and/or drunk, and easy pickings. Also, the trip is an all night deal with no place to stop, so once the fun begins, it won't end until it ends...eventually those on board learn there's a killer among them (after the corpses start piling up), but he could be disguised as anyone, so who's to be trusted? Oh yeah, a magician played by David Copperfield is also on board for the purpose of entertaining the rubes, performing his illusions (never call them tricks as that really ticks him off). Like I said, I liked this Canadian produced movie, at least the 2nd time around. I'm not sure what changed, other than the fact I'm older, but I think I have a bit more appreciation for the effort put into developing the characters within the film. I believe this helped, especially in terms of Jamie Lee Curtis' character, as we saw she had real empathy for the kid who got tricked not so long ago (apparently she tried to visit him after he ended up in the hospital), along with strong disliking for the person whom she saw responsible for the prank, that being Doc, a self centered, manipulative type, mostly for his cruelty, but also because of the way he used her in his scheme. The result of all this was an effort to make us feel for Curtis' character in that maybe she didn't deserve the same fate as the rest, and it work, for me at least. The movie does fall within the `slasher' realm, but gore hounds will most likely be disappointed as there's actually very little bloodletting violence. Spottiswoode, in his directorial debut, instead seems to be focusing on the suspenseful build up, rather than on the visceral material normally present within the genre. I thought there was some very decent scares throughout the film...I didn't jump out of my seat or anything, but the movie did keep my attention. The goofy bits for me was how well the killer was able to keep his identity hidden, even after those on the train realized who was the one responsible for the killings. The story does throw around a red herring or two, but at one point, before his identity on the train is revealed, you should be able to discern which passenger he is...there was a definite sense of claustrophobia, as most of the film takes place on train that has only three or four cars, but then this also made the difficulty for those trying to find the killer seem all that much more, well, dumb. One element that didn't really help was the amount of time spent watching David Copperfield perform his magic. His character, who seemed quite smarmy to me, did figure into the plot, but it just felt like his lengthy performances were included to help pad out a decent running time. I don't mind magic, but I would have preferred there not to have been as much as there was since this was supposed to be a horror film. It was kind of funny, though, given how seriously he takes his craft, to see him stuck on an excursion train having to impress a bunch of drunken college kids. I did like the bit after the main conductor, played Ben Johnson, discovered the first body and attributes the death as being caused by `some kid messed up on dope'. As far as Ms. Curtis, her presence here did help a lot, and probably resulted in quite a few seats being filled at the time of the movie's release given her prominence of `Scream Queen' in the late 1970s/early 1980s (she had all of three films out in 1980...this one, along with The Fog and Prom Night). Overall I found this to be a fairly engaging film, one that rises slightly above that of your run-of-the-mill slasher feature. The picture quality, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks decent enough, and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital mono and stereo comes across well. There's really not much in the way of extras other than a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles, available in both English and Spanish. Cookieman108 
Maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking, but I doubt it. Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie, the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new. I went to high school with kids like this and I've bought the Eminem CD. And there's a little more to them than the stupidity. But let's discuss the movie. Anne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. (??). Seeing her boyfriend beat down, she's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating. Then she goes to parties, gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer-inspired ghetto talk. The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner, but well he's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner. Actually, he's coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat. Yes, it's ironic that she's trying to dress ghetto while he's trying (not very hard) to dress suburban (wife beater is suburban?) The movie's climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their "crew" and if the gang didn't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked, they sure have it then (and really, who doesn't know that that's gang initiation standard - started by the Hell's Angels in 1965). After that disaster (both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid. There's a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people, but it's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie. The one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls' character from Hustle Flow (and Hustle Flow in and of itself) since that's a white character in a black world that doesn't fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser. He's just himself whereever he goes. He's someone the morons of this movie could learn from (but really wouldn't you rather just see them all shot dead? 
Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program. There are 6 10 years old, and they were bored turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,- You MUST be able to teach instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program. 
There are many reviews here and I believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree. My main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once. If you do, it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place. Daniel Day-Lewis once again makes this film. You feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the "wrong woman" (Pfeiffer) after being engaged to the "right woman" (Ryder). He is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film. Due to circumstances beyond his control, he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman. There is a palpable, underlying eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair. After I had watched this film one time, (primarily due to Day-Lewis)I had decided to give it away. I left it alone for about 2 weeks and then watched it again. Since then I have watched it several times and I enjoy it more and more with each viewing. My only real complaint; I hate the blond hair they gave Pfeiffer. It's just all wrong for her. Nevertheless, she is so beautiful. Take the time to watch this at least two times. If you do, I think you'll find it's a keeper 
The product produced a clear picture good sound it was like being back in 1975 and experiencing that World Series for the first time. I enjoyed every minute of the games and interviews 
This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end. I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted 
I have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi's acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly. Alas, not a film that I can recommend to anyone. 
I just wanted to find out and please let me know dat is the A*Teens music video "Heartbreak Lullaby" which is part of the soundtrack for the movie on the Princess Diaries DVD ..lyke as in the Bonus Features or something?? ive been trying find out but i cant so plzz lemme know cuz I just wanna get the DVD for the music video!! 
Nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent. Every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even William Shatner would envy, and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical. As anybody who has seen this show knows, the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double-entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for British comedy. (Although, as "children" of the Three Stooges, Americans are, I think, accustomed to somewhat heavier-handed comedy.) For those who don't know this series, it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids (I wouldn't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20, by which time they will probably find this material boring). If you are assembling a comedy collection, however, this series fills a unique niche. My only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate. It doesn't even come in a box, but rather in a little "accordion-folder" package which is neither aesthetic nor practical (can't stack) nor particularly protective. It is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them (I chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble, but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape; works fine) 
First of all, 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks. Second of all, I missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain. Also, regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises, it is still moderately difficult 
Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo. Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters. They are the traditional "Mars" and "Venus" symbols representing masculinity and femininity. I also understand the last symbol representing "infinity", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of "eternal life" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity. But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values? (The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity) I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot. Please also forward your thoughts to VBoston at aol.com. 
I recently purchased this DVD and was beyond disappointed with it. I actually ended up fast forwarding just to get through it. I expected a true documentary with maybe a few interviews with people who were there, with the firemen, or anyone at all but the video is mostly silent. I can hear the fire fighters radios but most of it is so staticky it's hard to make out. The film has a few comments by the person taping it but that's it. The film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble. I found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom. I own several other documentaries that I watch over and over as I don't want to forget the feelings I felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country. This DVD was a HUGE waste of both my time and money. 
I love this video. I get up before anyone else so that I can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long. It's a fantastic meditation, though, that centers me for the entire day. Ravi Singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear. Ana Brett does the poses very clearly, and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses. I have already recommended this video to friends 
I am absolutely in love with this movie. It's a real documentary, not a mocumentary, but it is hilarious. The special features on the DVD aren't amazing, but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful 
I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common. I can't say I really liked either. The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one. Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides. Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough. Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role. The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted. 
Even though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive, this is by far the best adaptation of the famous British Navy story. Gable and Laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed. I'm not a huge Gable fan. This and Gone W/ the Wind are abt all I like him in 
Right after watching this, my wife and I called our (now) 14 yo dancer in to see it. She in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over. The look of amazement on ALL of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission. Like the commercial says; DVD player; $200, DVD; $15, Watching your daughter work ten times harder on her tapping-priceless 
'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a classic Frank Capra film from '39. Starring a stellar cast of some of Hollywood's best from the "Golden Age" of cinema it's not only one of the greatest films of that era, but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of America was something to be proud of, not mocked. Yes it's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions, however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us. Can the young and naive Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) survive in the United States capital as a newly appointed Senator? Will he check his ideals and values at the door and play the political game or will he stand up for what's right against the "powers that be?" If you're any kind of movie buff you already know the answer. One of Capra's and Stewart's best and definitely one of the Essentials to any DVD collection! 
Ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house. 8 women, every one of them with their affective lacks, their tribulations. Little miseries, sorrows and disillusions. Each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered Marcel. The admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage, with a sublime red carpet that remind us Bergman in Cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo) expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film, plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses. A must-see! 
This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of the first and this and enjoy 
Movie was pretty good. Coming of life story about a boy from Jersey trying to make it as a bartender in the hottest club in the city. Addresses teen issues such as, drug abuse, sex, betrayal, jealously and family 
As much as I like Paul Newman, this movie is very disappointing once you've seen the far-superior film "Day One". The portrayal of Oppenheimer and Groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people. The movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the Manhatten project. Be sure to see "Day One" if you are interested in this, and give this film a miss 
There are so many reasons to like "Wild Things" it's easy to call this movie perfect. Although it's not the best movie ever made (or even in the Top 20 for that matter) it truly is a perfect movie...For what it could've been. I borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it, it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity. Well, this movie does have a plot and it's quite complicated. Some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes, but you can't argue that this is a damned good movie. Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School. Lombardo is a lady's man, in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he's done half of Blue Bay. Well, Lombardo has a student named Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards, who i've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie) who seems to be coming onto him; Lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother Sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in Blue Bay. Well, one day Kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash Lombardo's car for the senior car wash and then we see Kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face. Then, Kelly says Lombardo raped her. Lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer (Bill Murray). Well, then another girl named Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) says Lombardo raped her as well. Another player in the plot is Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon), the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories. Now, this movie is one of those films where you think you know what's going on and then they throw a wild card. After that, you think you know what's going on again and then s*it happens. Even when the movie ends, you don't know the full story until the credit sequence. The sex scenes (the most famous with Denise Richards, Matt Dillon, and Neve Campebell) are quite nice, but surprisingly the movie would be good without them. This is a really great movie and worth the $5 bucks it would cost to buy it. 
To violent for anyone! This movie is horrible. The cast is good, but the plot stinks! Its just this family who have super powers. Then this kid wanted to be Mr. Incredibles side kick. (in a way)Mr. Incredible says no so then he hates him. Then the kid turns evil and kills people, and wants every body to like him. Thats origanal. There are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes, and there is way to much violence. Killing, guns, punching, bombs, and they say stupid words sometimes. I do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence. So I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Especially the 2 disc special edition! 
Well you know the drill. Some people will like anything that is "artsy" or "out of the ordinary" or "made by that great director". Its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless. The movie is about incest. It is about sex and adolescence. And, ironically, it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews. The best part of this movie is Eva Green. Or, more precisely, Eva Green's body. I didn't care about her acting (I thought it was mediocre). I just sat there and drunk her body in, wishing that I was that lucky actor (whats his name again?). The only reason to watch this movie is Eva Green. If she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation, then I am glad it happened. The movie is visually rich. In fact, its so rich that Bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see. But I will take it. He captures and celebrates Eve Green's stunning body - every square millimeter of it(including her genitals - the movie is NC17 for a reason), to perfection. Other than that, there is nothing else in the movie. The story is utterly insipid, the old movie clips, the "discussion" of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting. The music is another plus point. Bottomline, watch it for Eva Green's body. It deserves five stars. But the movie deserves only two 
I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since. This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story. Who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise? Navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking. A wonderful, wonderful film 
I'll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I'll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I'm not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke'mon lovers, I'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that's made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell. I was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn't know the half of it. What I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, 'stand alone complex' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date. Taking place in a fictional city of Japan called "Niihama-shi" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply "Section 9". The series follows the exploits of Section 9's agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as "The Laughing Man". Public Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs. If you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as "tanks" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere. I think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that's foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it's just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places. if you like anime or manga you'll definitely like this show. It's complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is. 
If you sort of like Edwin McCain, get this DVD, watch him live, and you will fall in love. He has such passion for his music that can only be seen, and felt during live performances. His amazing voice, is just as amazing live, and he and his band, can JAM!! The energy is high, and its a great time! I had the priviledge of meeting him, and blubbered like an idiot, but he is just as cool a guy as he seems. He really appreciates his fan base, and understands how important it is for us to see him live. Im glad that finally, I can share with my friends who have never see Edwin live, what an amazing artist he really is!!!! 
This should have been better but Angela Bassett's performance was the best, so I guess it's worth a watch 
I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry 
Murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle. Which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a "regular Don Juan" to his neighbor Winston, a family man. Murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago, searching for a possible son, whose existence is unclear, and who may just be a hoax. The visits are all shocking in different ways. All women live in similar locations, though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth. All encounters are odd, the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident. She was number 5 in the list of "suspects" for the mother of the phantom son. Don't watch this film if you need action or a plot. If you are happy with smart dialogues, odd situations, great acting, a script worked to perfection, this is one for you 
Stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic. Not one single "fact" about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film I had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won. What a crock 
First, off, if it has Pauly Shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny. In this comedy, Pauly Shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money, little does he know when he picks their area of expertise, water clarifacation, that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty. Watch this movie 
SPOILERS When Star Trek's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season, they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold The Cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode. The result: One of the most important and brilliant Treks ever done! Everyone knows the basic plot by now: Spock kidnaps his crippled former Captain, and hijacks the Enterprise, and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all The Federation. He eventually is court-martialed en route, and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the Enterprise's visit to Talos IV 13 years prior. THIS is the episode which cements Spock's character forever: the supposedly emotionless Vulcan, who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans. Leonard Nimoy's performance is one of his best as Spock : initially seeming as though Spock had gone crazy almost, kidnapping Pike, using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders', all sorts of indications SOMEthing must be wrong with Spock...until after the Talosian's plan is revealed,where it is found THEY have been manipulating events all along, and Spock returns to his stoic self.....except..when leaving the briefing room with Pike for the last time, his head bowed, shoulders slumped. Shatner's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles. I say :'unfair'...Frankly, it is PERFECT for the events - all during these events, Kirk acts rather stunned at all these events: His friend and 1st Officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship, he almost dies going after him in a shutle, THEN he is releived of command for all of this! By the time the Talosians supposedly abandon Spock and forces the trial board to take a vote, even Kirk is convinced Spock should be put away.But..at the end..is able to smile when the Talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated' Pike happy again at last. All of these performances are directed with care by Marc Daniels, the veteran TV director who was at the helm of the 'envelope'. They make an deliberate point of cutting to the more mature, unemotional Spock during the famous 'laughing' scene,and you can ALMOST see a flicker of 'was I THAT emotional?' cross his face! The makeup used on Sean Kenney, the 'substitute' Captain Pike (Jeffery Hunter was unavailable),might be some of the best ever done for any Trek: it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage: you are totally convinced this is an older, horribly maimed Jeffrey Hunter! Some small parts of The Cage are cut: some shots of Pike's fellow 'zoo-mates', some VERY sexist lines about 'women on the bridge', and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer' scene. None of these are very important to the plot of EITHER the pilot or the envelope. And just to add some trivia: Part II of The Menagerie was the highest rated episode of Star trek ever in prime time! Actor Malachi Throne had been the original voice of the Talosian Keeper in the pilot. Since he was cast as Commodore Mendez, voice artist Vic Perrin was dubbed in as The Keeper. As per the Director's Guild, Marc Daniels was credited as director for Part I, while the director of The Cage, Robert (Mr Pilot) Butler, was given the screen credit for Part II. The Menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish! 
Normally I love documentaries. I've watched hundreds of them and with one exception I have loved them all. However, OUTFOXED is the single most boring film I have ever seen. A relentless rant against Rupert Murdoch's cable news station, this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with Fox News, but I cannot imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in Fox News to remain awake while watching this movie. Watching OUTFOXED makes me realize what a genius Michael Moore is. Whether you love him or hate him, whether you agree with him or not, you have to admit his films are entertaining. This film, however, is a major bore. - Regina McMenami 
Despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality, this film is a complete put-on. The long "set-piece" scenes (wedding, Russian roulette, etc.) are much discussed, usually either in the context of being "essential for character development" or "boring". In fact they're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film's awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything "happen" narrative-wise. 2 stars is rather generous, but De Niro, Walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting, albeit for such a misguided cause. Ultimately, despite some controversy, many of the film's questionable portrayals of Vietnam, Vietnamese, America, Americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy 
There were loads of Swords Sorcery films coming out in the 80's, most of them low budget garbage. But this was actually one of the better films. It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable. Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant. Pretty standard stuff. But it's exectuted well. The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard's Conan Story "The Hour of the Dragon" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer. In the Conan story the sorcerer's name was Zaltotun. In this movie, the name is Xusia. Mere coincidence? I think not. But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame). He's suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life. Unfortunately Xusia doesn't get enough screen time. Lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here, too. Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan. He's a fun-loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne. He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross, although it's an "X" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism. Again, this is a scene lifted from a Conan story "A Witch Shall be Born" when Conan was nailed to a cross. Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon, actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately. Now, I'm no doctor but I'm guessing that someone who had a 4" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but, ok, it's fantasy so I'll buy it. Still, despite some shortcomings, this is an enjoyable little diversion. The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized 
The concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded "The Girl in the Cafe" turned out to be a left-wing political message. I wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character "Gina"? Gina browbeats the members of the G8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world, particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows. Does the thought ever cross her mind (or the person writing the script?) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS, all varieties of venereal disease, children born out of wedlock, etc? Maybe Gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly. This movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an R rating for nudity and language 
Now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004. A relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them. Bob Roberts, a son of a hippy couple rebels against that world view and uses music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda. Marketing hate and intolerance in the flag, this movie frighteningly shows in fiction what is being done in reality today. I think Bob Roberts will be a movie that historians will study 200 years ago and see it relevant for discussion of the United States around the turn of the millenium. 
Unfortunely this movie was a sleeper in the theatres when it first came out. But check out the cast! Jo Ann Fleet (thoughtly modern millie) and Robert DeNiro in a comedy.An a comedy it is. It's just pure fun and a great uplifing movie if you have the blues. It's so funny and you won't be disappointed,,,i promise. 
My son LOVES airplanes and jets! I bought this DVD based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video. If you want a DVD that shows airplanes/jets flying, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The name of the video should be, "Watch the Blue Angles Get Ready to Fly," because that is what this video is. In the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying. Then the next 25 minutes is NO FLYING just talking and showing the Blue Angles getting ready for their show. In the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show. My son has never made it to that point. He wants to see airplanes/jets fly and I'm now on a new search for a DVD that will do this for him 
Ohhhh! I caught this movie on regular TV and even with commercials it was good. I bought it so I would get the whole movie. I have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family. A really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you! 
The last time I saw the names "Adam Goldberg" and "Giovanni Ribisi" together, they were two American Soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain Private Ryan. Goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long. At times towards the end I was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to "Memento" or something of that nature. What this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels, that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution. Some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning. Despite a stellar cast that besides Rabisi also features Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Vince Vaughn, Haylie Duff and Elvis Costello, it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey. Rabisi stars as Gray Evans, a movie star actor who is having marital trouble. Gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set, going through fan email, and getting bugged by people, that a fan is stalking him. Relentless in his obsession of this belief, he starts obsessing about others around him. Great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales. We understand that Gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time, of being the stalker, but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring. The ideas are there, I just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all. The sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing, and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat. If you like Independent films, or want to try something different, by all means give it a try. I don't see it as being something I would watch again, or have in my collection for killing time on a Sunday afternoon with 
Why does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release? Connery in a remake of Thunderball.... Is this not a relesae by the same production company? It is a MGM release, so why doesn't it ever get included? Any light that can be shed would be greatly appreciated.. 
my daughters ages 8 and 6 like the movie but my son who is 15 months really loves being able to watch all his Sesame Street friends in a movie 
I was so disappointed with this video. I thought it would contain more than it did, but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all. I had one ashtanga yoga lesson and expected this video to at least cover what the lesson did, but it fell far short. This only contains two very basic sequences - surya namaskara A B, it doesn't even go into the full series and I do not think it gives a very good representation of what ashtanga is about. There is no instruction in standing or sitting poses at all! The two sequences are introductory sequences that lead into the poses, but this video just stops abruptly at that point... I found ashtanga to be a wonderful blend of relaxing yoga that also gives a full body workout. As soon as I did it, I felt that I had found the perfect exercise and bought this video as a way to practice at home. I ended up giving this video away after watching it twice as it does not contain enough information for the beginner to be inspired or even motivated to study ashtanga further 
This was much, much better than I expected it to be. A real tear jerker. If I was to let myself cry, this movie would've been it, not "The Joy Luck Club". Andy Garcia surely deserved an Oscar nomination. He was simply great. I was not a big fan of his, but here he clearly impressed me. Of course, he was also terrific in "The Godfather Part 3". Meg Ryan was effective, but still a little too cutsey, with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films. But the two daughters were outstanding, especially the older one, played by Tina Majorino, who appears to be about 7 or 8. Also, the look of the film, set in San Francisco, is good, especially the interiors of their house. Garcia really seems to care about Ryan. This movie is about love, and how it doesn't always carry the day with alcoholics. I also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things, they've been married and had a kid (you don't learn til much later that he is not the older kid's dad), and we see her drink a lot. They don't start with how they fell in love, or even attempt to explain why she's an alcoholic. Smart 
Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it. The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point. In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period 
I guess I expected more out of this movie but I confess I was mildly disappointed in it. At first, the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling. Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. A fun movie but not particularly memorable. 
We have all heard about `Product Placement' especially in the James Bond films. Did you know it goes all the way back to DR. NO and was very prominent? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons, notice that those cartons are labeled `Red Stripe.' That's right, `Red Stripe' Beer from Jamaica! In this case `Product Placement' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film. In fact DR. NO is one of the best films of the series. It is much closer to Ian Fleming's prose than most of the other films thanks to Sean Connery's performance, Richard Maibaum's scripting and Terence Young's direction. At the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here. Production designer Ken Adam's sets, attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional, adorned by Syd Cain's detailed Art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in DR. NO the benchmark. Peter Hunt's intuitive and effective quick-cut editing paced the film like no other at its time. Maurice Binder's brainchild opening `gun barrel' is an incredible piece of Title Design, which is equaled only by the `James Bond Theme', composed and re-orchestrated by Monty Norman and John Barry. Ted Moore's cinematography, especially the shot of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea, is now a classic and also set a standard for future `Bond Girls.' We are introduced to the organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in DR. NO. What is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Wiseman. He is unlike future main villains of the series. He isn't exactly what you may call a `social animal'. Joseph Wiseman's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made Dr. No one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series. In a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen Blofeld in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL. Rounded out by the beloved M portrayed by Bernard Lee, the lovely Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell, John Kitzmiller as Quarrel and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, DR. NO ranks as one of the best. 
I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse. The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC. I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents 
I go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this DVD to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if I didn't want to leave the house. I was a little disappointed in this DVD. I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising. The routines are broken down into four separate workouts. The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section. As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them. I think this DVD is great for beginners. Its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon. But if you're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine, this probably isn't the abs workout for you 
Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there 
We own three Baby Faith DVD's. Our favorite is "God Made Music", followed by "God Made Me". "God Made Animals", while still a good video, is our least favorite. For one, the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing (but judge for yourself, I've posted some pictures). The frog was creepy - since when do frogs have lips? The visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too. And the undersea clips at the end looked as old as Cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one year-old son, who is entranced by the other two videos but doesn't seem to care much for this one. My suggestion...watch before you buy, if you can. If your kid likes it, go for it. If not, try the other videos. You may get a different reaction 
It is the ultima of CGI video game movies. I must buy for Final Fantasy addicts. 
The film deserves 5 stars but the DVD only gets 1. Why: no letterbox format. After waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on DVD, why would they give us full screen / pan scan? Yes, the quality and color are great but oh, what we're missing on the sidelines 
No, he doesn't. Angel Heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective, Harry Angel and Lou Cyphere, obviously the devil. Well, not obvious to me at first...ha! The only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it. The voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition. Voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a "devil" character since there is no devil figure in voodoo. However...the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices, it just happens to be how the devil got involved with Johnney (the missing crooner). Mickey Rourke is stellar in this movie..Bonet is enchanting...Deniro is flawless. Worth owning! 
I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book? If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do. I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright. If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds. It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even. I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful. I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is. I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right 
(1) Scarlett O'Hara is the least likable "heroine" I've ever seen. She has no redeeming qualities. (2) We're supposed to sympathize with the South and feel nostalgia for the good old days when white folks could own black folks? (3) This movie is way too long and dull. (4) I'm glad they burned Atlanta to the ground. (5) There was nothing honorable or respectable about the Old South and the plantation way of the life. The "gentlemen" were nothing but racists who thought they were aristocrats because blacks did all their work for them. (6) I'd rather watch "Mandingo" than this racist garbage any day of the week 
I am not sure why the first person would direct people to read J. Michael Bailey's work... or why the second person would say that it is as if J. Michael Bailey wrote this himself...one he couldn't have because it is a documentary, and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary. Considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community. And he was forced to resign from Northwestern University as the department head, because of his illegal uses of his patient's information in his book. "They seem like different species, because they are." I am not sure if I would say that the kids in this documentary are another species... or even that I am another species. They are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous. I am not sure why everyone is referencing him, because his view on Transgender people is extremely negative. ... but to the documentary. I think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community, showing that we can stem from all different backrounds, and we can act in all different ways. Just as there are many different "normal" gendered people, there are many different trans people as well. I believe that ScubaOtter "seaotter7" has the best overview of it. 
I've owned the LaserDisc version of "New Order Story" for 5 years and watch parts of it at least once a week, so I thought having the DVD version would be an upgrade. Not at all, it's a cheap transfer from LaserDisc. The DVD containing "A Collection" has defects in it. I mainly bought it so I could have the full version of the promo for "The Perfect Kiss", -which in "story" is almost ruined by Bono's horrible voice- but it turns out it has a huge skip in the DVD version. I didn't even care to test the rest of the disc and just returned it. 
These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu. However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this ) Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way 
When I read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts. I thought, "Yeah, right." But you really can pick and chose and combine what you want. You can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio. It is up to you. Or you can choose from the basic low, medium, or high intesity workouts. This is a great workout DVD and Denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part. I'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home 
Don't bother wasting your time with this movie, instead read the book. The book was one of the best I have ever read, the movie left me wanting. I rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through. So maybe I am being unfair since I did not watch the whole movie, but honestly I couldn't, it just didn't do the story justice 
This review might contain some spoilers....I was disappointed with this anime. After all the reviews I read I was expecting alot more. It was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon Chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over. There was some humor but all in all I would not waste money on it. Infact, I took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after I purchased it 
This show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal. From the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i've been a huge fan of the series. I was so sad to hear it'd been cancelled but I wasn't surprised. It was one of the shows I loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air. Now that the DVDs are out I can relive these 13 fleeting moments in TV that are, to me, some of the funniest things I've ever seen. Apart from the hilarious, oddball performances from Michael Michael and David the series was packed with guest stars including Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, and a whole lot more. Really, anyone that is a fan of comedy ala Strangers with Candy will find this funny. It has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts. Favorite episodes include: Campaign Paper Route Coffee Shop Novel Meeting Girls and Vegetables The extras on the DVD are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode, a lengthy and interesting "History of Stella" and much more. The commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other, giving some insight into the creation process, while remaining pretty well aware their show met with sub-par ratings. They take it all in stride and aren't too proud to poke fun at themselves. I think if this show had been on comedy central around the time Strangers with Candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons. It's a shame. Definitely worth getting, turning off your phone, and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season. "And when I say plow that's a pun! 
This film itself deserves 4 stars at least. Im givin this s*** a one cause its a f***** bootleg. I tried to play it in 3 different dvd players to include an x-box and it would not play. Then when I finally got it to play, it looks like one of those copies that got transfered from tape to disk and it looks and sounds like s***. If your into purchasing s*** like that then I guess this is for you. I advise you to cop this movie somewhere else 
SUNSET BOULEVARD is a drama that reveals the unsightly day-to-day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense. Joe Gillis (William Holden), a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers, holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. While walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool, he is shocked to discover it's occupied by old silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Living with a devoted chauffeur, estranged from Hollywood and forgotten by fans, in Desmond's mind, she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years. Knowing the script doesn't have a chance, as a writer, Joe looks at this as an opportunity to "fine tune" it to earn some extra cash. However, the working relationship is not all that tidy. It seems lonely Desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo. His payment is a warm place to stay at night, a closet full of clothes, nice meals, private "parties," and Desmond's ever-present company. If it were possible for Desmond's self-admiration to be supplanted by anything, it would be the possessiveness for Joe's affection. Young Joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend. Through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and, naturally, develop feelings for one another. The girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on SUNSET BOULEVARD is a formidable challenge. With some of the most memorable quotes in Hollywod, this is a wonderfully produced "noir-comic" drama by Billy Wilder that well projects the intense emotions, not only of each character, but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent. Other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are ALL ABOUT EVE, AN IMITATION OF LIFE, and WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. A gem on the DVD extras is the history of fashion legend Edith Head. Movie quote: "There's nothing tragic about being fifty. Not unless you're trying to be twenty-five. 
Joseph Campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story. Haru (Chris Farley) is a ninja school dropout. He still maintains a positive attitude. He gets an opportunity to help a Sally, a lady in distress (Nicollette Sheridan). His mission will eventually take him to the hills of Beverly. Sensei (Soon Tek Oh) is like a father to him. Sensei realizing he can not sway Haru from his mission sends another ninja Gobei (Robin Shou) who is Haru's spiritual brother to quietly help. On this mission Haru, Gobei, and Sensei learn more about themselves. 
I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it back in July. I still can't understand why the critics just didn't get this one. This has to be one of the best second films ever made in a Trilogy. The addition of Davy Jones was brilliant. It made the film much darker and more dramatic. Johnny Deep was superb as usual. I still can't believe that the film made $400 million dollars domestically and over $1 billion dollars worldwide. It's surreal. But everything about this movie was so on point that it's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film. I enjoyed this one more than the original. I thought the story was more interesting on this occasion. Although, you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of Geoffrey Rush's character. He and Depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him. It was a huge void to fill. But enter Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and all is well. I guess that's one reason why "Dead Man's Chest" woks the way it does. Billy Nighy gives an A-list performance. And when you add in Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, it's money in the bank. The only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original "Star Wars." Yes, I prefer "Pirates" over TLOTR. Although, perhaps my comments are premature since "At World End" hasn't even been released yet. Should that be a dud, then of course the whole thing falls apart. But here's hoping that the third time is a charmer. If you own the first "Pirates" on DVD then you have to get this. Don't miss out. 
This is [...]. I suppose anybody who'd hire Adam Sandler and/or Tea Leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from Cro Magnon man could watch. I lasted 20 minutes. The "jokes" are older than me, and they weren't funny when they were born. There is a world that exists nowhere except in American TV and film. It's an ugly place where nobody acts human, preferring to cling to stale stereotypes. A place where writers without talent set their stories. A place they grew up watching on American TV and in films, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. This film is set in that world. No human being has ever been to this place, because it only exists in the minds of hacks. From the writer and director who brought us BROADCAST NEWS, which I reviewed recently. It, too, was in the pretend world, but that was okay because it was a film about a TV show and it had a bit of wit and perception. This has none of either. It's a damn shame this is the only way Cloris Leachman can get work. 
very exciting and will keep you glued to your seat. i have just watched (2006) for first time..... 
....for several reasons. Apparently, the other online reviewers are extremely over-analytical in their critiques of this film. The DVD's jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone..."Think 'Sex and the City' with men!" Well, I say, "Think again." As an avid watcher of "Sex and the City", this film has little if any comparison to SATC. Firstly, this film is not a comedy. There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh. Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!). The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person's life. These disjointed glimpses don't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters. Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30's or their 50's. Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs. I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however. The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions, only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film 
most of this season is about Topanga and Cory breaking up and getting together. I think the second season is the best though. 
THIS MOVIE IS NOT VULGAR NOR DOES IT RATE NC17...DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE. CHECK OUT PINK FLAMINGOS INSTEAD, NOW THAT IS A VULGARLY RIGHTEOUS MOVIE BY WATERS AND THE WITH THE GODDESS OF FILTH..DEVINE 
Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs. 
Quality was as good or better as I could expect from VHS tapes from the 70's, but loved the DVDs... I did notice minor 10 second syncing problems with Disk 1. 
Everybody knows the plot of this movie. So, I can't add anything in that respect. However, I can tell you that the quality of the DVD is very good. Clear picture and sound - great buy 
Maybe you've heard that "it's all been done before." Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie. It really is something new. McKean has worked for years in the comic industry, defining a visual style that works at a visceral level. The style has many ways to look, depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy. Some times McKean's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone, other times it's a pen-scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken. Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience. I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well, I was wrong. This movie's imagery defies easy description. I can only invite you to see it for yourself, and to experience a movie that is truly like no other. The small-screen video makes me regret missingn the big-screen theater experience. The sound track generally works well, too, from the surreal drone of Mrs. Bagwell's Victrola to the nightmare chant of the Jill-in-the-boxes during Helena's transformation. I'm not normally one to notice, but Mirrormask's music complements its look flawlessly. You didn't come here for the story: light and dark in conflict, lost mystic artifact, plucky youth, untrustworthy side-kick. The acting doesn't distinguish itself either, despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes. Stephanie Leonidas does a good job in the Helena role, with a convincing sulky/sultry mix. If you liked the acting in the original Dr. Who series, this will rise to your highest expectations. The story isn't the strength here. You'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy. //wiredweir 
The documentary was really, really good. They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense. One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day. Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr's Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s! I don't know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing. Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun. They really played up the Flyin' Brian stuff as being ahead of it's time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing. Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn't really long-lasting if you think about it. The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill. The accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not. He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him. Anyhoo, the official coroner's report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over. I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) "sports entertainer" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job. It's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale. The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in. Best parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff. I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars. Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW. They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee. I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too. They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993. Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick. They were so hilarious together. Another great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF. That was sad stuff. JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal. Overall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5. I haven't watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries. 
In the annals of Criterion this has to be one of their most bloated, pointless offerings. This film is just ridiculously bad, not fun, just kind of depressing to see so much wasted effort on such a pathetic script. If you really want to watch 1960s Willis O'Brien-inspired stop motion animation watch anything by Harryhausen and call it good. Equinox works only as a curiosity or Mystery Scince Theater 3000 fodder. If you want to see great low-budget Southern California filmaking, watch "Halloween" 
Dont get me wrong, i'm kinda young but i love 80's / 90's movies specially the horror ones. I had great spectation for early Geoge Romero movies. But both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad. Gorge Romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry, but for today standars they are not, even they are not that good for most of the 80's 90's movies. The Bad: 1. Acting is not beleavible. It looks like the were "acting" 2. The dialog's are not how people actually talk. 3. The soldiers at "Day Of The Dead" are a shame, they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline. They behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups 4. More than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other. 5. I think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans (listening music, shooting, "talking" ) 6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment. Theres is not any frightening atmosfere . The Good: 1. The gore scenes are really good, maybe too much bloody. It shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated. So far the only great zombie movie i have seen, beleive it or not is Resident Evil 1. Resident Evil 1 has it all. Resident Evil 2 NOT. Resident Evil 2 is one those "just shoot and kick" movies and I'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo. So if you want a gory movie, maybe you may like this movie, but the gore is just at the end of the movie. You will be better pleased with "Cabin Fever". If you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe Resident Evil 1, Poltergeist, the original japanese version of The Ring and The Grouch, ScareCrows. Alien, Aliens and even Alien 3 not Alien 4 (It Sucks). But the Best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price 
This movie is going to bring you down. That's a fact. But it's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves. A classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man. It's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the U Boat service 
Up until last years Match Point, Crimes and Misdemeanors was considered Woody Allen's last great film. I've only seen 3 Woody Allen films (not counting Match Point) that came out after C and before MP, but I'd have to agree. Crimes Misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with Allen's greatest work. Films like The Purple Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall. It's a perfect blend of drama and comedy. In fact, Match Point was kind of a retread of this film. The drama without the comedy. This movie stars Martin Landau ('Ed Wood') as Judah Rosenthal, an eye-doctor (I don't remember the term for one) who's been having an affair with a woman named Dolores (Anjelica Huston, 'Buffalo 66'). Problem is, he's tried to break it off but Dolores isn't having it. She's, instead, threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife. He's barely intercepted the letters. He looks to a patient, a rabbi (Sam Waterston, 'The Killing Fields'), for help...But it's not working. When he turns to his mobster brother Jack (Jerry Orbach, 'Law Order') for help. Jack suggests murder. Judah reluctantly gives in. Meanwhile, a filmmaker named Cliff Stern (Allen) is tapped by his brother-in-law Lester (Alan Alda,'Mahattan Murder Mystery') to make a documentary special on him. Cliff hates Lester, but isn't getting work anywhere else. While working on it, Cliff meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow, 'Rosemary's Baby') whom he falls for, despite being married. In typical Woody Allen style, the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters. I liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies (as a character was watching them) that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie. The movie is separated into comedy and drama, kind of like Allen's "Melinda and Melinda." The drama part is the Judah plot. The comedy is the Cliff plot. Although both of them drift into the other category occasionally. They both finally come together at the end. The movie simultaneously reminded me of Match Point and Manhattan. The former for obvious reasons, the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to Allen's character. Anyway, the acting is great of course. As is the dialogue, as always. There's a lot of great one-liners ("I haven't been inside a woman since I visited the statue of Liberty") and some physical bits of humor as well. If you're a fan of Woody Allen, you'll definitely love it. GRADE: 
This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about. Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort. 
For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world. Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a "Special Edition" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement 
On December 14, 1944, as American troops under General Douglas MacArthur slowly advanced toward the island of Luzon, Japanese guards at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on Palawan committed a terrible act. Herding their Allied war prisoners into trenches, they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive. Utah native Eugene Nielsen, private first class in the 59th Coast Artillery, was one of the few who escaped. Filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of Morotai, where Nielsen described his experience to an Army intelligence officer. News of the massacre reached the POWs at Cabanatuan, as well, and prompted the U.S. Army to embark on one of the war's most dramatic missions -- the Bataan 
Definatly one of the worst movies ever. The dialog is so boring I had an A.D.D. attack trying to watch it. I usally never turn a movie off in the middle but I had to do it with this one. I tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it, so I would never have to suffer through this again. The characters are so lame I did'nt even care about who was threating his life. I wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already. Man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it. IT FU**IN SUCKS!!!!! And it is really dated 
The movie was terrific, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because there was quite a bit of Spanish in the film, and the subtites from Spanish to English didn't seem to work on my copy. English subtitles appeared for Engliish, and Spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke Spanish! Strange. Fortunately I know some Spanish, so i could sort of pick it up, but I don't know why the sub titles didn't work. Anyway, Bogie was very good and the story was too. Three men set out to find gold, and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey. Besides all that were the usual bandits and Indians and so forth. But it kept you watching and that's what really counts. Won't tell you if they got any gold! 
Who could ever forget the image of happy-go-lucky Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle, infectious Portuguese accent, "Yo ho little fish don't cry don't cry". If you're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from Spencer Tracy's signature movie, `Captains Courageous' released in '37. Plot: Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), an Ill-mannered rich kid falls overboard off a luxury vessel and finds himself adrift until a passing merchant fishing ship pulls him out of the sea. He is taken under the tutorage of his rescuer, a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Harvey is initially hostile to the thought of having to obey orders and work for his room and board until the ship returns to dock, but eventually comes to understand the important lessons in life being imparted by Manuel. Before his adventure at sea is over he'll learn what it means to be a man. This is without a doubt my favorite Spencer Tracy film and a story the entire family will enjoy. It's beautifully filmed with a tremendous cast which includes along with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew the legendary Lionel Barrymore as Disko and John Carradine as Long Jack 
Spider-Man (2002.) The first Spider-Man film. Spider-Man 2 (2004.) The second Spider-Man film. INTRODUCTION: In 2002, the first of the live-action Spider-Man hit theatres. It's not likely that the film's director, Sam Raimi, had any idea just how successful his big-screen incarnation of the classic superhero would be. It drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres, and the DVD releases did the same. The sequel, appropriately enough, was even more hyped, and did even better. And now, both films have been combined into a single set! Read on for my review of the Spider-Man films. STORYLINE: Essentially, this set includes both of the films. The first of the two films explains how Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into Spider-Man. In the first film, the villain is former head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn, who has been transformed into the Green Goblin by a chemical he was testing. The second film continues two years after the first left off, and features Spider-Man facing off against Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body. This time around, juggling the duties of being Spider-Man with work and school have made Peter Parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle. OPINIONS: Both of these films flat-out rule. Seeing the first film turned me into a Spider-Man fan practically overnight. The acting and storyline are both excellent, particuarly Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Everything the first film did well, the second one does even better. I was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film, since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them - but Sam Raimi does it here. These are great films, and the fact that they're together in one package only sweetens the deal. DVD: These are the standard DVD releases of the film, meaning each one has a bonus disc of material. There are a ton of bonus features, including commentary, cast and crew interviews, and assorted other extras too. The second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books, and the plotlines of them! That's my favorite extra on either of the discs. The other features are also excellent, and if you like the films, you'll agree they're worthwhile. OVERALL: I can't begin to express my satisfaction with these films. The cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece, and I think you'll agree superhero movies don't get any better. Being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet. These are must-watch movies, regardless of who you are. Even if you're not a big fan of the Spider-Man franchise, you may be pleasantly surprised 
Well, this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust. Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine gal--but that's why they call them movies. When are these post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them, not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations. Uh, another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert, something which should be, and for a time is here depicted as, a foreboding and life-threatening task. Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog; and we see the boy's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner, considering the dire situation they are in. The sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted, inane scenes. Look, I dig Disney kid movies--more realistic ones. You know, old style Disney movies. You take "Old Yeller" for example. Now there was a quality kid movie, and quite true to life. This movie was not. It had a plastic, spoiled-American-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout. Disney has gone down the tubes. In any number of ways, they've been subverted by radical Marxist agendas (Note: One more of these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion--something called "tapping," while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-PC Judeo-Christian religion--this is bias, folks, leftwing, PC bias, same as the aforementioned feminist bilge). I am learning to run, not walk, away from Disney stuff, and this movie was further cause for me to do so. 
This is the type of yoga that gives yoga a bad name. I will not even give this one to a student or friend; put it in the Goodwill bag 
The story of a young award winner of a filmmaker's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get "his" first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by Christopher(Spinal Tap)Guest. It's a cynical and hysterical look at how Hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis. Unlike many of favorable reviewers I'm not a fan of Christopher Guest's later works and that's not just because I'm envious of him being married to Jamie Leigh Curtis(lucky dog). I don't find Guffman or Best of Show more than mildly amusing at best. Save for Bob Balaban in Guffman(When Sparky comes back, I almost bust a gut). Sometimes artists do their best work up front. I like Woody Allen's first three pictures the best(What's Up Tiger Lily, Take the Money and Run, Bananas). I think this is the case here. Guest hit gold. Great script, terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast. A near genius(I'm gonna steal one of the other reviewer's word here because it's so perfect, kudos and thanks) "turn" by JT Walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history(alas, another "great" dying so soon before his time like Warren Oates and Robert Shaw). Fabulous work by Martin Short, Teri Hatcher, J,T, Walsh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Fran Drescher, Dan Schneider, Jason Gould, Wakter Olkewicz and seriously I could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines. There are tons of people in this sublime comedy. Its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the Eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene(Bacon/McKean)that comes off as way too cloying. Other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of Hollywood. Someone said comparing this to The Player was like comparing Bagger Vance to Caddyshack. I'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be sub-par. Caddyshack is a classic and so The Big Picture. I am a big, big fan of Altman and The Big Picture is even par with The Player. If either were more biting I would give the nod to The Big Picture. Though, Richard E Grant's performance is almost as good as Walsh's. Nick's(Kevin Bacon)flights of fancy are hysterical. This is an inspired and unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy. 
I will not watch the movie "Andersonville" until they make a movie called "Elmira"(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate) 
i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it 
I loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3. WHERE IS IT? I hope that it is released soon. It seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending! A little unfair to the consumer don't you think! It is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is. Is that correct 
This is the best way to spend the evening with your children. It is very well done, and the actors made this a Neverland not to forget. We have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it, buy it, but most of all WATCH it 
While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie. This movie was just plain stupid. They should have kept this film story in the states. Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time. I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan. So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students? Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do? Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment? I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese. Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet. The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful. Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here. Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture. Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students. There would be nothing further from the truth. Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here. Not by a long shot. Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant. The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states. 
"Kings and Queen" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose. The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship. With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, "Kings and Queen" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. For instance, Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. Nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I don't think so. Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning. 
This is one of my favourite Christmas movies - along the lines of It's a Wonderful Life - modern style. Cage is perfect in this role- surprisingly! Tea Leone is a great supporting actress and the little girl is adorable - all around a wonderful movie - some mature content though so not for the younger viewers. (robbery and sexual nature in parts) 
Thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget. 
The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked. The animation was bland and ugly looking. The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn't blend in at all. (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others). The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says "IT HAS MOVED??" yells "SOIL IS MY POWER" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over. That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot. This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big "Final Fantasy" demographic. Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it. 
"Chamber" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience. Skip it if you can. 
I purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that I'm designing. Boy was I dissapointed! This film is for spectators and posers, not for serious Yogis. You can barely hear Shiva's cues over the music. The video is so focused on being 'cool', that it totally fails to instruct, cue, or demonstrate poses. Anyone who has never done yoga would be totally lost. And as for the trance dance....I was not entranced. The problem was that Shiva was very tight and I didn't get a sense of freedom from her. There was one guy that seemed to be 'in the moment', but for the most part the trance dance was quite silly. Not a good instructional video. All glitz, no substance 
A girl-buddy movie starring Shelley Long and Bette Midler as two women in love with the same guy. When they learn that he's "used" both of them, they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from New York to New Mexico. Silly and dumb, with the usual chase fare thrown in. Everything is a cliche, from the opposing personality idea (Long is an orderly goody-twoshoes, Midler a loudmouthed mess) to desert hippies to car chases, etc, etc. The movie seems to go on endlessly 
This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary. Two weeks afterwards, I still find my mind wandering about one thing...why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room? If I walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me, I'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin 
You can't really call yourself a Pauly Shore fan unless you love Son-in-Law. And it's hard not to love this movie. Granted, it is prone to a bit of cheesiness, but this is what we both love and respect about Pauly Shore. Becca is a fresh from the farm in South Dakota, now in California at college and on her own for the first time. She misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she doesn't fit in. But Crawl (Pauly Shore, in perfect Pauly form) her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be. When the holidays roll around, Crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for Thanksgiving, but Becca insists he join her and her family in South Dakota. Crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that's not enough to make things silly, Becca's boyfriend tries to propose to her, but Becca doesn't want to get married yet and Crawl announces to the family that he's already proposed to Becca. Now absolute silliness takes over and it's just so much fun from here on out. If you need something fun and funny to watch, give Son-in-Law a try. One of my all-time favorites in my collection of silly comedies. You'll love it 
I truly love this film and it's one of my top favorite film of all time. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. If you enjoy violence, beauitful scenery of brazil, a great gang-drug related story this film is absolutely brillant. 
Dull, dull, dull. If I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have. Pointless 
maybe i'm spoiled by big-budget sci-fi films, but i thought this movie kind of stunk. it felt and looked like a TV movie and wasn't scary, at all. the best/funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady's name or face, and everyone described her the same way--"the one with the glasses." "Oh, her--haven't seen her." LOL 
Foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina. As a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that's my only criticism. At this price, it's a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it's in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe. Definitely recommended 
I HATED THIS MOVIE. It is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does... stupid plot - too many holes and stupid ending. 
This review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only. Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version. You'll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place. I've watched this movie on my 40" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version. So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers 
Bergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect. Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne's marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation. In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them. Three decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift. Marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen Johan since the 1970s, it's time to make contact again. Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake. She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan's family. Henrik, Johan's son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin. Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik's wife and Karin's mother, who died two years before. Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams. The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman's own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him. Henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old. In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father. For Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father. Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself. She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she's going through. For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him. She's always wanted something from him, but since she can't define what it is, she'll probably never get it. The struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne's opening and closing monologues. Karin makes her choices. Henrik reacts. Marianne throws herself once more against Johan's emotional aloofness. As he's done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition. The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing. The Criterion's DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband. We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position. It's a treat to watch him work. One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin. One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through. Bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection. Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this: after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains: marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman's great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh. None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary. In the end, it's all you have. What's truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he's done. He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving. He will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced. But don't see Saraband for nostalgic reasons. It's a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon. Saraband stands on its own, but it's a deeper experience if you watch Scenes from a Marriage first. 
This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical "life affirming" stories. There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy 
Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On 
This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO 
This is one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it. And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part. I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them? Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC. I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up? And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted? What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending. It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience. I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that. I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other. The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen. RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all. Huh? He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back. This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after? Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously? It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway. It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after! It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
Up until now, "Basic Instinct" has always been that little movie in pop culture in which Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs and exposes her vagina for an instant. After watching this movie, that is exactly what I'll remember it for. This movie is pop culture staple, it's stupid and impossible to predict. As soon as you think you've got it, you don't, only to discover you do; as we we see with the ending. The movie what critics refer to as "a bad movie". And it is. However, people will forget "Gandhi" the Best Picture winner of 1980 something before they forget this movie. If you label your DVD collection, this would definitley be in the "Guilty Pleasure" section where you would also find movies like "Wild Things" and "Cruel Intentions". It's a movie that has big stars, a big budget, and a stupid story. But this all works perfectly. Oscar Winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, Wall Street) plays Detective Nick Curran, an ex-alcoholic and smoker, who's investigating the murder of a former rock star. The person believed to have commited the murder is Catherine Tramell (Stone), a novelist who's novel has detailed the killing exactly. As Nick discovers more about the case, he finds simalar incidences involving Catherine and at the same time he begins an affair with her. Probably not the best thing to do when you're pretty damn sure she's killing people with ice picks. The movie is packed with cliches and occasional bad dialouge that is only annoying sometimes. Oddly enough, Douglas and Stone are perfect in their roles. Stone catches the feroscity, sexuality, and glamour of Catherine perfectly; and Douglas plays the vulnerable, yet tough cop perfectly, as well. I can't see another actor in any of these roles, which is one of the highest compliments I think an actor can recieve. While it looks like Douglas made the smart decision by not returning for the sequel, I look forward to seeing Stone playing Catherine Tramell again in the movie. So, film buffs who actually know what a Best Boy Grip is probably won't like this movie; but entertainment seekers will surely like it. And hell, if you don't even care if it's a good movie...The sex scenes are great. IN REALITY: B- HOWEVER, VERY ENTERTAINING: A- 
Alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority. The character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by Aristotle. Watching this movie you get the feeling that Alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident. There is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential, and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of Alexander's strained relationships with his mother, father, friends and his own identity. If you're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient Greece, look elsewhere. This is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant. 
What a rip off! This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. Heck, this is the first time I haven't been extremely satisfied. Who in the world would purposely order a PSP disc of ANY movie?????? The heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two (2) disc set. It does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don't order this 
Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don't make movies like this anymore! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear, we're onboard for the ride of our lives, actually the lives of hero Cary Grant (1904-86) and Eva Marie Saint. The plot of this 100 percent attention-keeper thickens as its characters sicken. Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason (remember him? 1909-84) and ever-dapper Leo G. Carroll (who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper). Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama. Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock (1899-1980) I'd rate this in the top three, with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases. 
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
the movie directors in the ME, particularly Iranians, are responding to demands by the West for certain type of movies. They produce what is demanded from them; in turn, they receive awards. cultural industry empowers these demands; they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the Western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded. There is no single ME movie which depict the story of Western imperialism in the ME and then awarded for doing so. ME movies must show that ME women are in need of emancipation; ME cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized. civilization itself is presented in vertical sense; there is a civilization somewhere out there all MEasterners are expected to reach; yet, it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them. (no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country; who deprived them of education and knowledge. the West is represented by beautiful, blonde nurses, a nice American guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his "everyday Western knowledge of medicine" in the midst of total ignorance, and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs. such a nice way to civilize!) the story of Afghanistan is real. however, the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it. rather, it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand; in producing a product that can sell well. the situation is miserable; but what caused such misery in Afghanistan? your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is Islam; it is that Islamic culture; that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes. such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors. there is no single implying in the movie, a smallest reference, that Afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the British and then the Russian and now Americans who played their Great Game on the chessboard of Eurasia. There is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them. those imperialists came in the name of civilization; French did to Algeria, the British did to India; all in the name of bringing them civilization. It was White Man's Burden to do so. Yet Makhmalbaf needs more awards. he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of Western audiences, in order to continue to be in demand. you did a nice job, applauses; go on. (anyone who is interested in cultural imperialism should read Foucault's works and Edward Said's Orientalism. 
There is a coliseum video about the World Heavyweight title. The tape ends when hogan was champ on his first reign. That tape is great. Gorilla Moonsoon with the commentary. The JR commentary doesn't make this garbage any better. The matches are like De ja vu let me think yes I have seen these before. Because these matches are on each and every other dvd. The extras on the dvd show the split seconds each title change. I really mean each clip has to be about 5 or 6 seconds. I know these matches were supposedly decided by the fans. I know I voted. Were the votes counted in Florida ? There are a million other matches that could have been on this dvd. I got the first disc from Netflix because I was not going to buy it. Some may say "He is crazy it was great". Maybe for you it is. I have seen all of that before. I wanted this dvd to learn something new about that history. There are no perspective segments or interviews. Just overrated JR running his yap over matches he never called. I want to hear the real commentary with Jesse not JR. But WWE screwed that up. There are a lot of things just wrong about wrestling now...oh I mean Entertainment. It's garbage now. WWE has put out some good dvds its just they did a crappy job on this one. Hitman, Jake Roberts, Road Warriors, Monday Night etc etc. The dvds about the old days are the only things I look forward to because their current product is garbage. So when the thing I look forward to is as luckluster as this dvd sorry if I get a little ticked off. Experienced wrestling fan get it on Netflix or borrow it and go and get the Coliseum Video if you can find it. Rookie fan it would be informative to you. 
Vol. 3 marks a new low for Family Guy: A season that started out strong but ended very "OH my god, I was so shocked by that hahahahaha". It seems to be riding on it's laurels, so to speak, and it's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don't like it, and I think it's been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I'd like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD's have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven. We only get thirteen episodes of crap, and maybe we should be grateful, but all in all, whatever. Raoul Duke 
Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it has it all; suspense, good acting, good story line, and without much violence. The plot is interesting, it keeps you guessing, and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great job Hollywood, to all involved with this film, especially Jodi Foster 
Unlike Marshall Fine,who wrote the Amazon review, I don't find the subplot in this movie hard to swallow at all! Sadly, politically I believe many of our fine military personnel have been sacrificed through the years for political agenda, and I am not just talking about recently. I am sure there are flaws in the movie, but I wasn't watching the movie for flaws. Truthfully, military movies are not my favorite genre. Having said that, I found myself up very late one night and "happened upon" this fine movie. I was mesmerized. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson were brilliant, but it was the short segment with the former officer in the North Vietnamese Army that riveted my attention more than any other scene. Just brilliant! I can't say more or I will spoil it for anyone who has not seen it. Needless to say, I give it 5 stars because it is a movie that made me think, one I will talk about in years to come. That's a barometer for my star-meter! 
All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid ( underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you! 
The original "Candyman" sucks so bad, but everybody praises it and I kept wondering to myself, "am I missing something?" So, I tried watching it again and it still sucked as I could not even get through it, so I figured maybe I should watch the sequels and maybe I would find something that I liked about this series. Well, after watching "Candyman 2", one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish...again, the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme. The villain in "Candyman" makes me want to laugh because he is so NOT scary...if you want a good laugh, watch the "Candyman" series, but if you want to be scared, you would even do better to watch "Ren and Stimpy". In all seriousness, watch "Halloween" and "Halloween II" if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn't try to send a social message. LOL. Some people call "Candyman 2- Farewell to the Flesh" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish 
I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target.... craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation.... The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie. The scenery was indeed spectacular. The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered. Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful. OK, enough of the shallow stuff.... the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well. The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc. Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives. Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks? No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day. 
I have watched the first disk of the Tick, and I laughed my ass off!! I am working on getting a copy of it in order to send it to Comedy Central, and requst that they air the first season on their channel. I think that Fox screwed up by cancelling this show, and that Comedy Central should pick it up. It is by far the best show I have seen in awhile, and deserves to be resurrected!! Thank you 
I have been using Callanetics off and on since the 80s. I was so excited to see that it came out in DVD format and wasn't discouraged to read that it didn't have chaptering - Callan always has recommended doing the full workout anyway. But, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this DVD now has chaptering. So, please don't let that discourage you from trying this awesome exercise program! You will see truly amazing results in a short amount of time. I have used it only 3x so far this go around and I already feel stronger and have better posture. Have fun 
What the HE77 was that??? Yo I tried Cam, your music is straight and all but hang up the camera and pick up the mic. Stick to your day job (rapping). 
The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about 
I never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd, I was excited, remembering the magazine from when I was a kid and being a fan of ILC, SNL, and comedy itself. I am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others don't. I write this review now as I am TRYING to watch the third disc. I got the dvd the first day it came out and I have to watch every dvd I get, even if I saw it before. Regardless to say, I only broke a smurk ONCE throughout the first 2 1/2 discs. I even tried watching parts of the disc when I was having a great day and even when I was not in the greatest of moods. I was in a good mood again this morning so I started watching it. I think it is the lamest show that I have ever seen. I really don't know why it ever lasted past the first season. If you've seen the show on tv and you like it, more power to you, if you haven't seen it, don't buy it, it is a waste of money. Everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny... I personaly don't think I should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny 
Those who describe this story as "cute" and Joon as "quirky" aren't paying attention. For me, this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity. The writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness. Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie 
Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh can be heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised 
Wow. It's rare I consider a movie absolutely horrendous, but this one qualifies. We are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy, and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie, I found myself yelling "DIE already". When he doesn't kill himself in the end, all I wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him. A dumb stupid awful "indie" movie that is a waste of film, time and effort 
The answer is No Deal! In Ruthless People Danny DeVito is great as Sam and Bette Midler as Barbara is terrific but together they are a miserable couple. Sam, who has a girlfriend, Carol, wants out of the marriage but, doesn't want it to cost him anything. When he learns that Barbara has been kidnapped, he thinks he has it made! By not agreeing to pay the ransom amount, no matter how little that might be, he counts on the kidnappers to save him from paying alimony by bumping Barbara off! The bumbling kidnappers are Ken and Sandy, adeptly played by Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater. They have a grudge against Sam who stole their dress design and made a mint. They are astounded when, after giving Sam their demands, he emphatically says, 'No Deal' and hangs up on them. In desperation they lower the amount. Sam still says, 'No Deal'! Barbara learns Sam has refused to pay the ransom not once but twice! She is furious and can't believe that she has been marked down like clothes on a sale rack! Barbara and Sandy create a bond when Barbara, through a better diet and exercise, has lost weight and needs different size clothes and Sandy provides her with clothing she has designed. Barbara loves the designs and they decide to form a partnership. Their first agenda being Sam and the second developing a clothing line. The plot thickens when the police become involved, thanks to Carol. As suspicion focuses on Sam, he is forced to come up with the ransom to clear himself! Fuming, he gets the money and drops it off counting on the police to arrest the kidnappers and retrieve his money. The drop off does not go well. A car chase ensues! And then what happens next is . . . hmmm . . . let's just say Sam's fortune takes a dive 
After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please. 
Boy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this 
This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire. He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don't want to give away too much here, but a clever use of 'Hollywood Hijinks' and the line 'Don't believe everything you see' fit with the story very well. 'Postcards from the edge' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be. As in 'Dressed to Kill', DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he's been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it's about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn't work any other way. Like 'Vertigo', this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work. All in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times. Melanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans 
Don't bother. Just don't bother. It's sad to see 
Yul Brynner stalks about like he's in Westworld, acting super-tough, smoking every chance he gets. Steve McQueen, as always, is terrible. As for the rest of the "7", their acting is atrocious to non-existent. Only Eli Wallach walks away unscathed. Yet if these things are irritating, it is the blatantly sexist and racist undertones to the entire affair that just make it heinous. Yul Brynner actually says that he "might" rape the women of the town in one scene sarcastically. Amazing this could have ever been construed as being "tough". It's just ridiculous, and these distinctions are what sepeartes this pathetic remake from the masterpiece it shames. But I'll give it one extra star for being relatively well staged and directed. 
This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing. I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it. Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again. I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake. This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long. Hidalgo is the name of the horse. So what? That's about as boring as this movie. So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo. I did not, however, like this movie. It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again. If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
I quite enjoyed watching this film, which is why I give it four stars, even though I think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic. So, why did I like it? Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Kevin Kline (in that order) and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience. Joan Cusack is wonderful here. Her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up is fantastic, and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street, screaming "Is this the Twilight Zone?" at which point she collapses on the hood of Matt Dillon's car (in her wedding dress no less) -- well, that scene is adorable, especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity. Yes, here is the heart of the film (so I cannot comprehend another viewer's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film; she's obviously going to marry the movie star, and get to eat cheetos into the bargain). Matt Dillon is, as ever, the essence of cuteness, and a much more desirable husband than Kevin -- um, I mean Howard. Kevin Kline does a decent job of mimicking Howard, a repressed gay man. But it still feels like mimicking, rather than acting. Here is also where the problems begin. I guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay. And, similarly, the Barbra Streisand gag is beaten to death (and beyond). How many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like Barbra??!! Come on! Also, Kline's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture . . . Not only is it not enough; it's really kind of humiliating. Nonetheless, the final scene does give "Mr. Holland's Opus" a run for its money, and I can't deny it: I did really have fun watching this movie. It's basically a sound little production, well structured, reasonably well written, and Kevin Kline can dance 
I expected so much more, because it's Marshall, but regardless of where you purchase this, IT'S EDITED. It's pathetic. This is Eminem! I understand you have a daughter Mr. Mathers, but DO NOT MAKE ALL OF US WATCH AN EDITED CONCERT. This is probably the MOST ridiculous thing I've ever bought. There's not even a warning that it's censored. You just buy it, pop it in your DVD player, and listen to a concert with mostly EVERY OTHER WORD jarbled up. It's a useless DVD. There's NO POINT in buying it. First Encore, now this. I've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90's. As somebody from Michigan, I saw him before he was Mr. Cartier global super star buying skin treatments at Barneys. I've never been more disappointed with an artist. 
This is a wonderful inside-Hollywood thriller/comedy directed by Robert Altman. Tim Robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers. He thinks he's figured out who it is (Vincent D'Onofrio), goes to meet him, and in a rage kills him. He then falls in love with D'Onofrio's weird girlfriend (Gretta Scacchi), an artist who can't ever finish anything. There is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed - only to be rescued at the last minute by the D.A. Altman's theme has to do with the Hollywood version of reality, which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks; it has nothing to do with "truth." A long list of Hollywood stars make cameo appearances. It's really a well-done movie, very classy and hip. Altman also satirizes Hollywood power players extremely well - it's a whole other world out there in LaLa land 
Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of Company (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word concert or soundtrack in DVD title 
In my humble opinion, the real stars of this sorry sequal were the cars, e.g. the Corvair, Buscemi's Caddy and Cuervo's 1959 Buick. How often do you get to see a '59 Buick, either in the movies or in real life 
I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming. But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you. See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack. They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart. They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully. It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality. Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player. And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile. SO. NOT. FORNEY. I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life. That horrid. And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role. Hello...?!?! Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too. Read the book, don't watch the movie. You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story 
Kids will be kids! Within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive, honorable and brave. These raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of "love." Risk becomes only the next step. Susan Sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength, courage, wit and willingness to go up against the BIG, tough bad guys with all the money and power. Tommy Lee Jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power "fools. 
This movie may not be for everyone, but to me it's highly memorable. POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: This isn't your ordinary "travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about"-flick (Back to the Future--although, granted, it was better made and more entertaining). Butterfly Effect is really about (in alphabetical order) acceptance, chance, charity, choice, grownup love, hope, identity, opportunity, regret, and sacrifice. Some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting. Here are my thoughts: Kutcher to me always seemed an innocent, caring, small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as, and that's why I wasn't surprised to see him pull off this role. Amy Smart was good mostly, but glaringly off-key at times (granted she had to show more range the the other actors) 
Whatever ills are in the world, it's all the fault of the corporations. That's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that's why they took that job in the first place! These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people's skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people's labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average. There are no shortcuts to his. A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families. It's a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process. Government-mandated "shortcuts" usually produce results which are even worse. However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the "evil" capalism its corporations. No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone. Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don't measure it to the cost of living in the West. What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about!? Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath. A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate "being" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it?? Several of the main "spokepersons" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality. To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are. Throughout the whole movie, you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 1/2, it's more like 80%-20%). Just look at Chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need. I mean we don't need fashionable clothes (hey, let's all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun. Who is the judge of what you REALLY need? Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't. You're too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do "more important things", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about). The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It's also FULL of economic fallacies. It's worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie. Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life. For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds? Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.) If these and other governments (and not corporations') problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away. An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for. 
Unfortunately this MS collection is not compatible with European DVD players. The cover of the DVD actually tells you this as well as that it is 'not for sale or rent outside the US and Canada'. Save yourself a lot of trouble and don't buy this if you are from the EU! 
Let's face it; some of the jokes are funny. The one about Mike Tyson been like someone else's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny. I also found the bit about Bill Clinton and Osama Bin Laden also funny. However, Jamie dwells too much on the fart joke. How can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes? After 2 min it becomes worn and so "unfunny". Why does he repeat himself so much with that line, "I am not saying she's a crackhead, just a bit crackish"? It sounds very rehearsed after the second time. If it were only for these errors I would have found the jokes altogether acceptable. What I found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against Arabs. I am black myself but found some of the jokes about Islam and Arabs to be in bad taste. Jamie could not even get an Arab accent right. C'mon, guys the accent Jamie pulled was an Indian accent and not an Arab accent. I kept asking myself, "what would black people do if a white comedian (say Robin Williams) makes the same crude jokes about black people?" Would it be acceptable?". I think not. I am sure the black press would slaughter Robin if he did. I wish to call a spade a spade. Nonsensical, crude racist jobs against any ethnic group (black, white, Asian and yes Arabs) are not funny. They degrade and demean. For not even managing to get an Arabic accent, Jamie deserves 2 stars from me. 
While I've always loved Blade Runner, the so-called "Theatrical Cut" was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation. Harrison Ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped. But Hollywood, in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience's intelligence and artistic sensitivity, stuck with it anyway, on the assumption that we needed to be spoon-fed with sophomoric incompetence. Equally stupid, though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted, was the inappropriate sappy ending, which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well. It didn't even make any sense: the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars. But Hollywood, with characteristic cowardice, trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience. Rick Deckard's fate at the end of the Director's Cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982, and the subsequent VHS audience. It reminds me of what Orion Pictures did to George Romero's Monkeyshines. (Since when does a Romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots?) Or how about the "happy ending" grotesquely grafted onto Terry Gilliam's Brazil? The extra footage between Deckard and Rachael, while not extensive, enriches the characterizations, however modestly, and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end. The only thing I regret is that the extra bloody footage - in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes - found on the old VHS tape was not included in the Director's Cut. Which means that this is not fully the Director's Cut: the material was left out to garner the sacred, almighty "R" rating upon the film's re-release, as it was the first time around. One would think it would have been restored on DVD, but Warner, with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude, decided against it. They probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that Ridley Scott would have wanted it that way. Can anyone say "Eyes Wide Shut"? The fact that there are viewers course enough to value the "theatrical cut" and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that Hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all. And "definitive" the Director's Cut is: despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage, there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again, by anyone. 
This is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s. Jessica Lange truly deserved her Oscar and Tommy Lee is excellent and of course Powers Booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies. I can't even tell you how many times I have seen this movie and I will watch it again and again. 
Saw this Movie at the actual Premier in NYC and met Sturla Gunnerson and I told him exactly how I felt. Gerard Butler needed a bigger horse. I expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater. Sarah Polleys language was uncalled for in the film. They could have written better lines. The fade in, fade out was like a child filming with a video camera. The film was funny at times and mixed with gore. Like eating sweet and sour. Being a Gerard Butler fan I was distressed after watching this film. Why did he do this? Gerry Butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes. This unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like The Jury, Please or The Phantom of The Opera. I expect Mr. Butler to be past these B films and know he does have much better stuff in the works...than goodness. All in all the film was terrible. The scenery was captivating and breathless. I at times found myself saying wow, but it was about the story of Beowulf Grendel and it did not meet my expectations that I have read even in the easiest translations. All I can say is Mr. Butler your an incredible talent, becareful what you choose. Movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral. I know Mr. Butler is indeed better than this. 
This is the worst Workout tape that I have ever purchase, the trainer switches moves to quick and doesnt explain what she is doing like she expects you to know before hand what she is about to do. I am personally gonna smash my copy of it. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because the ratings dont go lower 
The tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer. For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England. Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury: U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down. British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war. Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl'. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims' road to Canterbury. The night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious "Glue Man". Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims' Road from Kent to Canterbury. Until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you. Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Be sure to get the Criterion version with the second DVD. The main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian Ian Christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star. 
I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay! Now, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD. I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too. Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio. VIDEO: C- AUDIO: A FILM: B 
To be honest, I think I found this by looking at listmania lists when I was searching for other anime titles. I had never heard of it, but the reviews seemed good and the price was more than attractive so I decided to give it a shot, although I didn't really expect too much. Boy am I glad I bought it! The only thing I didn't like about it was that there were only 4 episodes. I know this review says pretty much the same thing as all the other reviews, but I figured I should throw in my two cents anyway 
What's all the fuss about. Ms. Hepburn doesn't act. Our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time. Eddie Albert's restraint is utterly-unbelievable. Any two-bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions! What is Peck left with? A long life of knowing he's got a girl friend he can't touch, see, or speak with. I find this movie depressing. Hepburn chooses the stifling life of a princess for the "honor", instead of following the man she loves and running down that empty corridor screaming out his name as he walks out at the end, having chucked the whole royal kit-and-kabootle for her man. Peck choose poverty instead of instant journalistic fame? Albert takes one for his buddy and is now stuck doing endless pin-up photos in his dank drab loft? I mean really people. Would you like to live with the staff at the palace? Endless "League of Nations" speeches, and all the time wondering what the man of your dreams is doing? I'm sure she'd face the fate of Lady Di trying to escape her monotonous life. And to think she may even risk marrying someone like Prince Charles, a stiff approved of by her entourage. Depressing. Peck is forever seeing what could have been as no one believes a word of what he says when he finally comes out with the truth on his deathbed. And the only source he has is the former pin-up photographer down the hall in the rest home, the one who constantly mutters at the ceiling, "my photos coulda been a contenda" while taking pictures of nurses with his 1950 pinhole camera, the one without film they let him keep for patient management sake. Depressing. We should have heard a "WAIT" as Peck walks out of the last frame. Audrey running, her tiara falling to the marble floor, shoes flying off, holding her dress as the entire press corp chases after the both of them. They jump into the river again. Eddie, knowing she'd break, waits in a scooter and off they go into the roman sunset for a TRUE ROMAN HOLIDAY. But NOOOOOOOOOOO..... 
Awesome movie, great for laughs. And you don't have to be high to enjoy it. This isn't Ghandi or Shawshank Redemption. It's not supposed to be the best movie ever made. But it does give you the laughs, so just keep laughing and stop taking it too serious 
I had to watch it in my 8th grade PE class and it is very informative and somewhat graphic. It shows the scariness of it and makes you eat for one thing! You wont ever forget it 
Most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but I wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is. I am a long time U2 fan and had seen Rattle and Hum, but didn't get around to purchasing the DVD until late 2005. The fact that the music is wonderful is a given, but the cinematography is just astounding. I love how you get to see everything from every point of view. You get to see what the band sees on and around the stage, including the breathtaking sea of fans. You get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes. You get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on. And of course you get the passionate music. The film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to. I couldn't ask for more 
You only need to read the book by Whitley Strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is. 
The New World is the least of Terrence Malick's limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third. Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn't crop up. 
I'm not big on anime, but watching one episode got me hooked. The voices, the animation, the story, the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch Samurai Champloo. Each and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more. 
I was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story. It found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie. Having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows. Still it is worth looking at. 
This movie is utterly unremarkable -- actually, scratch that. This movie is actually VERY remarkable -- because of how BAD it is. First of all, the protagonist is pathetic: it's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful, weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems; all she does is cry and moan. Second, the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers I've seen in any movie. Third, there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered, which disrupt the movie's flow and continuity; for example, the protagonist gets hit head-on by an 18-wheeler truck, and her car is absolutely mangled, but she walks away without a scratch. Someone care to explain how that's possible? I probably would have stopped watching this piss-poor excuse for a movie if I wasn't at a friend's house (and there's the fact that it's his movie): I sat through it just to be polite. When all is said and done, this movie just isn't worth your time. I'm glad I'm not the one who actually paid my hard-earned dollars to buy this piece of dung 
About a young scientist (played by Charles Martin Smith) who goes to the Arctic to study wolves, their survival, and their effect on the caribou herds (he proves they are not killing the caribou, as it had been assumed). He is a fledgling in the wilds, but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves. He notices the wolves eating mice, and begins to do the same himself - a supreme irony in this Disney film. The first half is excellent, compelling and beautiful to watch; but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a man-as-encroacher bad guy message and a confusing man-as-wolf Indian mysticism presentation. It's wonderfully photographed, though, and the soundtrack is stunning 
This movie was alright. I give it five stars for being artsy, quirky. It makes Gay love look systematically funny, and easily made fun of. Even people with AIDS deserve a better look at their lives. I do not have HIV/AIDS but have lost friends over it. This is a movie for those who either want a good laugh, or a good cry. I know of nobody who really acts as these characters do. I doubt it goes on in New York Citys Manhattan either. Purchase this if your just wanting to add to your GLBT VHS, or DVD collection 
Date Movie should be shown non-stop to all captured Al Qaeda prisoners - only mass-murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish. Let me be perfectly clear about this: Date Movie may be the worst movie ever made; it's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of. You may cry, you may scream, you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film, but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here - not once. It doesn't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks. The only thing I got out of this movie was an awful headache. If you ask me, everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years - if not for life. Had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to Date Movie, he would have stayed in the ocean. Whatever happened to that sweet and charming girl we came to know during the first couple of years of Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Why and how did it ever come to this: Alyson Hannigan humiliating herself in such raunchy, tasteless, unoriginal drivel? She can still light up the screen with that smile of hers, and she certainly put a lot into her performance, but I'm embarrassed for her here. She plays an overweight, very disgusting waitress from a mixed family (boy, is it mixed) who is desperate to find her Prince Charming. After convincing Hitch (Tony Cox) to help her find love, she's given a complete overhaul (literally), plunked down into a reality dating show, and actually finds a man. We watch them go through the dating stage, the meet the in-laws stage, and the wedding stage, encountering a number of obstacles to their future happiness. Really, though, the story is unimportant; all the script cares about are stereotypes, clich�s, toilet humor, and things that make you go yuck. There's no joke too hackneyed, no visual too disgusting, and no dialogue too stupid to throw in the mix. I'm generally a fan of dumb comedies and ridiculous spoofs, but this mess doesn't even qualify for the genre. Date Movie is so utterly atrocious that you can't even laugh at it. It's a complete and utter failure in every way possible 
This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills. It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner. The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery. The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script: Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1: ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts) "Evil Corporation"? Why are you being redundant? The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great. Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance. I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it 
This movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying the Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand. The so-called "scholarly" comments, for example about how the Gospel was written 200 years after the events, are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate. Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this. It is very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying to tear it down at the same time. The worst examples of Scripture put downs are in the 3rd DVD. I gave the movie to a relative without that add on 
i really dont understand how people find this show funny. maybe back in the day it was something hot, but now its not 
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin 
There was one scary moment in this movie--the quick scene showing the girl in the closet when she dies..now that was creepy. I then awaited more moments like that. Nothing. nada. Lame. Tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb. And that young boy what is up with that?? He's trying to be like the kid in the Sixth Sense (who was brilliant and totally believable). This movie did not scare me. And the idea of people being afraid to use VHS tapes after this? Come on. 
Ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks. It seems to have all the usual bits: knight on a mysterious quest, lovable thief, and a loving couple under a vicious curse. Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film, due largely to the outstanding cast: - Rutger Hauer (the knight, of course), - Michelle Pfeiffer (the other half of the cursed couple), - Matthew Broderick (knave with a heart of gold), and - Leo Kern (aging hermit, in on the terrible secret). Saying much more would mean saying too much, but it has the fairy tale ending you'd hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs. One thing about this movie (or maybe the DVD transfer) truly annoys me, however. Someone messed with the colors, like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters, and hasn't learned how garish they can be. To whoever did it: please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time. Outside of that, it's a safe, entertaining movie. Enjoy! --wiredweir 
Read between the lines, Stephane is nuts about her, and totally paralyzed. This reminds me of Remains of the Day. Everything is inside, screaming to get out. But there we are, tension city, with nothing to do but yell at the screen, "Do something!!! Kiss her!! .." THe emotional tension is as tight as the violin strings in the background! Vive la repressione! 
This film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted. Occasionally the film lets itself down with it's editing. I sometimes feel disorientated thinking " wait slow down will you." Having said that - this film is well acted, and really puts you in the Netherlands of the 19th Century. It may not be as hard hitting and exciting as Turkish Delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching 
Frankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President's wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding). If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV's 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in this flick too. I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing. I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side. I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors. 
I am still awaiting receiving Dora the Explorer meets Diego.......I have ordered it twice once before Christmas and kept updating my order to ship when received and then I ordered it later and canceled the original order because it looked like it was available and then I got a delay again.......if you have any update on when this will be in and shipped I would really like to know......everything else that I have odered and has come from Toys R Us through Amazon I have been very pleaase with........ 
I guess when any era becomes old enough for the "Nostaglia Craze" to hit, we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying. Case in point the 1950's were NOT such an innocent age, and the 1970's were NOT that wild. Studio 54, and the Disco Era in general were about Freedom, Great Music, Great People Watching, and in general having a hell of a goodtime. For the brief period that it ruled the music charts, Disco broke down barriers, and the stars of certain musical genres were able to crossover. I often call 1979 "the year that music got close to the light". My BIG issue with this movie is that It FAILED to show that for many of us we took advantage of the liberation of Disco's (like 54), and ENJOYED ourselves. It was glamorous, it was over the top, and IT WAS FUN. Amazing as it seems, many of us did not inhail cocaine like air, and for some of us who did indulge, we did not become adicts, or for that matter guilt ladden. Clubs like Studio 54 were great palaces that broke down many barriers, and helped us escape the many issues facing the nation in the late 70's. Too bad this movie did not convey it. 
So disappointing. Hardly a dark/noir film, in my opinion. Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery. And there's no sex, except brief kissing which Lana always cuts short! I'm a James M Cain fan, and this doesn't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel. Everyone's too decent. Cora (Lana) doesn't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body, and she's always costumed like a perfect fashion model, fingernail polish and all. Frank (Garfield)is never lustful, never mean, never desperate. Always polite and decent. Not a gas station (except for one pump that looks planted) not a single oil can or wrench. Not a greasy spoon or diner, Twin Oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or B, fit for Donna Reed family. The 80's Nicholson/Mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark. Much more faithful to Cain 
Maybe this is not fair, to write a review without even seeing the DVD. I wanted to make sure Disney understands that people do read these reviews, and I am not buying this DVD, as Swamp Fox is incomplete! Three out of Eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase 
What's so 'ugly' about this movie? Because it depicts the truth? To all you parents out there, this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis. I know because I was once a teenager too, and this movie hits the mark. This is what happens when parent's don't have a solid relationship with their kids. This movie is not ugly, its just the straight up truth which most people don't like to recognize. It's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized 
One thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years. What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now. In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now. Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development. It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings. It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this. I can't blame Fox for pulling the plug. After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show. I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in. The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air. It's just unfortunate people didn't want to watch it. I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today. As it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show. Honestly, it's not enough, but will have to do. Do we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies? Aren't there more than enough of them on the air now? Most of these shows people won't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there's so many. Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together. One plainly obvious joke after another. I'm bored just thinking about it. We've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion. The times need to change. People make a big deal about Arrested Development because there's really NOTHING else like it on television. That's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon. People wouldn't be praising the show so much if there wasn't a good reason for it. Trust me, there's a reason for all the positive reviews. Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about. 
It have a plenty range of Glould's legacy. Personally I hate the contemporary music, honestly I bought it because it have one interpretation of the magestic Partita No.6 in E minor. It have a rear romatic influence, and definitly it don't have the same perfection with the greatest baroque influence that Glenn leave us in the one recorded in 1957. Nonetheless you will see the great personality of Glenn and its lively interpretation 
All about THE Benjamins is a funny @$$ movie.Mike Epps is funny. The polt of the movie is very interesting and funny. I recomend that you watch it soon if you have not seen it yet. :) 
I have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the Kids Channels. I was hoping the DVD would show each of his songs as they are performed on TV. Instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons. This would have been a better CD instead of a DV 
This series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year-old, but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters. Most of the plot's famous "unpleasantness" is just tacked on to the main story, and is of no significance. Apart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses, nothing much gets accomplished thought the series. The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series, so don't bother waiting for any meaningful information from her. The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he's been transported to, inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him. The most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman, who's included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying, "I got it! Let's rape a little girl, that'll make it REAL! Yeah, Yeah, I like it!" Having served her purpose, the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series, so a little more misery can be dumped on her. All the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation. The releative standout would be the villian, who suffers from bipolarism, and alternates between terror, anger, delight, and misery, somtimes all within the same scene. Too bad that was about all he did in the show. Well, that's about enough. If you have an appetite for "Kid saves alternate universe" themed anime, then you may like this. But I found it lifeless and massively overrated 
SEASON 1: Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit, incredible acting for a TV series, and classic plots. All around a great opening season for a classic show. SEASON 2: Great story lines, very different plots, thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff-hanger moments. The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made. SEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons. It's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting. The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show. Laura (Stephanie) and Remington (Pierce) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever-messy, non-relationship, relationship, and Mildred (Doris) is just starting to blossom as an actual "Gumshoe". It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons. The good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them. I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1-3 (because I've seen them already), as well as the final set of discs (Seasons 4 5), even though I have not yet watched them (I'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!). One MAJOR down-side (not with the show itself but with the DVD discs) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs--stopping completly, skipping to the end or back to the beginning, skipping chapters, etc. One disc will not even play in our computer, which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax. It's too bad that they don't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD's for years of non-skipping enjoyment. The same disc didn't have as much trouble playing in our actual DVD player once we were back in the States, but still skipped from time to time. Overall Show Rating: ***** (5 Stars) Overall Disc Rating: *** (3 Stars) 
Saw this as an inflight movie. Boy, did I pray for engine trouble, so we'd have to land and I could get away! Sucks or what? I liked Smith in 'I, robot', 'Independence day', etc, but this was awful. It's a one-joke movie. Problem is, the one joke was the one plastered all over the TV spots and trailers (the jet ski incident). The highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool - wish that'd been the main storyline instead - far, far superior! Will not be adding this to my wishlist 
I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder 
Pinocchio - 24.50 101 Dalmatians - 19.99 Mulan - 22.49 Hercules - 22.49 Peter Pan - 29.99 Lion King .. not LKII 22.49 Lady and the Tramp 24.00 Jungle Book - 22.99 Little Mermaid - 18.99 Grand Total: - 207.93 All of them are special editions and I've not the listed reduced private seller price, thats the straight up corporate sham price. I regularly shop for awards/trophys and I couldn't imagine a pretty case with plate gold finish costing more than 80 bucks thats 287.93 You could still take your sweetheart to the movies and Benigans for some baked potato soup for this inflated price. I'm not sure .. But I don't THINK this case is platinum, makes you look any younger, make you fly or will help you sleep better so .. I think I've made my point 
Along with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe. I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us. Yes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality. 
I don't care what people say, I got it right off the bat, what the movie was about I joy it as well .. Alien Predator .. kids,it worked just fine for me .. you got to love .. Predator ..kicking butt .. those cool look Aliens. It's fun watching I'll enjoy, years to come .. Calling Spaceship Earth .. Thank for the trip Thanks for dropping me at back home. Based more on Comic Books "Alien Vs. Predator" .. not so much on passed Alien Movies or Predator Movies. 
Except for the presence of Kevin Bacon, whom I like a lot, this would have been a real loser. There were so many things wrong. Directed by Paul Glaser with no surprises, no depth of character, a too heavy-handed Hollywood scenario. You knew what was coming a mile away. There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that's the best I can say. Oh, and the nun. She was pretty good too. The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script. Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed "Hollywood". Like when the village burned down. They were ready to just up and leave where they'd lived for generations. As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses. And there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game. And Bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain, get cut in the groin, then play basketball, all on a rotten knee. Please 
There are so many reasons to love all things Canadian: national health insurance for all citizens, the novelist Margaret Atwood and certainly Leonard Cohen. A group of singers got together to honor Cohen by singing his songs: Nick Cave, U2 and Bono, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Anthony et al. Added to their performances are footage from many periods of Mr. Cohen's life, interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well. We thus have this documentary that will delight Mr. Cohen's fans. At 72, Mr. Cohen may have lost a lot of his voice-- he opines that he never could carry a tune-- but he has lost none of his brilliant self-deprecating humor. The singers are fantastic; but why wouldn't they be with such words and lyrics? Nick Cave sings probably Cohen's most well-known song "Suzanne," introduced to the U. S. public so many years ago by Judy Collins. One wonders if the group drew straws to see who would get to sing that one. Anthony is great, of course; but the Wainwrights, both Martha (her rendition of "The Traitor" will put chills on your spine) and Rufus who sings "Everybody Knows," "Chelsea Hotel Number 2" and "Hallelujah" are not to be missed. Rufus' account of meeting Leonard Cohen for the first time when he was feeding a young broken bird shouldn't surprise anyone who has listened to his lyrics over the years. This film is one that those of us who love and revere this man will purchase the day it is released on DVD. 
This amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability. The combination of puppets and live action works really well, David Bowie is wonderful, and, all in all, it's a great family film. When I gave it to my two granddaughters, ages 8 4, they watched it wide-eyed and a little bit scared. But then they watched it at least once a day for the next week 
Why release WrestleMaina's that are already on dvd? Anther thing WrestleMaina is months away, it was a perfect time to release the big four in order. Survivor Series entire series, then Royal Rumble, then WrestleMaina, and finally Summerslam. Made sense but WWE really doesnt think well sometimes. 
Ok, so it may not be in the 5-star league, but it's a great movie particularly for those who are involved in scouting. My scouts think it's too funny 
I loved the series of the supermario bros supershow. I use to watch this all the time when I was in the 1st grade. Im still a big mario fan and I hope they will make an entire DVD collection. If they did I will buy the whole thing. I didnt know they were going to make this on DVD SWEET 
"Dr. Strangelove: OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" is one/third of the films that are considered Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces (the other two are 2001: A Space Odyssey A Clockwork Orange). It's a satire, released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today. Whenever you look at a list of great movies, it's on there. It holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#26), The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#3), is featured in Roger Ebert's "The Great Movies," and is just, overall, acknowledged as a fine piece of cinema. The movie opens with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launching an unauthorized nuclear attack against Russia. The general is clearly mad and believes that the Russians are polluting everyone's valuable bodily fluids. The only person who can stop Ripper is Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers), a British guy who listens to Ripper's ranting in disbelief. Meanwhile, at The Pentagon, the President of the United States; President Muffley (Peter Sellers, again) assembles a meeting in the War Room where he is told hesitantly by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) that the bombers can not be recalled, no one can reach Ripper, etc. In one of the most hilarious characters I've ever seen portrayed on screen, we meet Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, yet again) a strategist aiding the people in the War Room. Strangelove's right hand, covered in a black glove, has a mind of its own...It frequently throws up Nazi salutes and tries to kill Strangelove. Also happening in the story is one of the planes heading to Russia to drop the bomb. The ruler of the cockpit is Major "King" Kong (Slim Pickens), a character that was supposed to be played by Sellers but reportedly couldn't because Sellers had recently suffered a broken angle. The scene where Kong rides a nuclear bomb as if he was riding a bull is one of the scenes in the movie that you're not likely to forget. Now, this is a funny and important film; But it's not my favorite Kubrick film, nor is it the most entertaining Kubrick film. But due to it's significance and the performances (by Sellers, Hayden, and especially Scott) it definitely deserves the term "masterpiece." ENTERTAINMENT: B HUMOR: A- IMPORTANCE: A OVERALL GRADE: A- 
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
"Capote", directed by Bennett Miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace, was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005. It is based on Gerald Clarke's 1988 non-fiction book "Capote: A Biography". The film starts by Capote's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) interest in the Kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime. His knowledge of the criminals, especially Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship. The writer is sympathetic and sees in Smith a strong resemblance with himself, yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim. Capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it. "In Cold Blood" was his most famous novel; the one that established him as a legendary writer. He was left overwhelmed, confused and unsatisfied, however. The movie is quite ambiguous, though. Characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive. At many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations. For instance, people are always laughing heartily at what Capote has to say, although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter. The setting and the music were both barely significant. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is highly remarkable, the actor's resemblance of Capote is questionable. Hoffman is 5'10" and more stout than the slender, barely 5'2" Truman Capote. 
I'm not going to try to get all the characters names right in Yi Yi. And there are a lot of characters, an extended family and various lovers and children. Taiwan is a modern, impressive city, a place rarely seen on American television or film. I might be looking at Manhattan rather than Taipei. The computer engineer's family, the wife with spiritual emptiness, the teen daughter involved in her first serious sexual activity, the grandmother on life support, and the eight-year old son teased to exhaustion by little girls, they live in a high-rise condominium over a raised superhighway. Then there's the ner-do-well brother-in-law, so superstitious that he marries his pregnant wife only on a Chinese lucky day. His old girlfriend shows up at the wedding to raise hell. She returns at the babies Chinese confirmation for more of the same. A fight breaks out, kicking little men and screechy women. Our engineer had walked away from a young love, and while wife is with the monks, he renews the relationship on a business trip to Tokyo. He is in love. So is she, but, I can't tell you what happens without giving away this poignant part of the plot. Engineer's daughter is having a rather unusual fling as well. I've left out a ton of information as this film was close to three hours long, but watch the beautiful cinematography of Edward Yang, and his brilliant pacing. One thinks it is real life. 
Jennifer Love Hewitt needs to fire her manager. I've yet to see her in a truly good role. Those terrible Know What You Did Last Summer movies, Garfield, Heartbreakers, If Only, and many others weren't exactly memorable roles. The Truth About Love doesn't help bump her in that direction either. Not that I was expecting Oscar-quality when I looked at the back of the box, seeing a picture of her in a leather corset, I wasn't going off of words to know that I was slightly interested in the movie. I've owned it for a few months now, and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and I were in the other room playing games. She kept coming out every 5 minutes, and I could tell that she wasn't that interested. After giving in and watching it with her, I now wish we had all played Resident Evil 4 instead. After what has to be one of the most annoying "sweet" introductions, we learn that a man has mailed a valentine letter to his friend's wife, Alice, supposedly by accident. Yeah, real smooth. When Alice gets it, she assumes it's from her husband, Sam, and sends him a hot letter as well. He gets it, thinking it's from another woman, and the problems ensue. He starts to hide the letter from her, and with that in mind, she tests his loyalty to her. She texts his phone anonymously with some of the dirtiest things Hewitt's done in recent memory. But as it turns out, Sam does have a mistress, and things get more complicated. You know what? The entire movie's boring up until 3/4 through. You're better off just reading the back of the box for the plot summary, then skipping to scene 9 or 10. And that's one of the cons I had with The Truth About Love- the time it takes to build up to what's an actually good conclusion with Sam's Anonymous admirer doesn't seem like it's worth it at first. But I'll admit, Alice's plan to bust Sam was a good one, though she gets a harsh slap of reality once everything's over. The key problem with the movie is probably that it takes place in England, and Jennifer Love Hewitt's forced to take on one of the worst accents I've ever heard. There were a few times when I thought that they hired a voice actor to dub over her lines- it doesn't sound like her, and mouth movements often don't match lines. And that's funny considering the majority of the cast is from the UK. Then comes the unbelievable part about a guy cheating on a woman of Jennifer Love Hewitt's stature. There's no way in hell that could ever happen unless the guy is mentally challenged (ie- Carson Daly). The kicker is that Sam's mistress is a woman who looks to be in her 40s, and pales to Hewitt in any physical category. And how about that Archie guy? He's in 3 important scenes at most. All the other times we see him involve he and Sam's court room scenes which I have to say, are some of the most boring attempts at forced humor. In fact, the trial doesn't even have a connection to the central plot aside from showing that Sam and Archie are friends and partners. Alice's friend is also a complete hussy, and seems like she didn't make the cut of being on Sex and the City. Finally, guys, I'm sorry to tell you this, but there are no scenes of nudity here aside from when Alice visits an adult movie store. Though the best we get from Hewitt is her in a corset, it's only for a few collective seconds. The love scene is kind of laughable too when she's wearing that ridiculous wig. Even right now, I still have mixed feelings about the movie. Just when something completely stupid happens, something decent does right after it. This is some of the worst picture quality I've seen in a while. The transfer looks terrible. Even watching it on my HD Monitor, there were tons of errors. Grain, artifacts, and something new. I almost want to call it rippling- many scenes are out of alignment, and we get a watery effect that takes over the entire picture. I can't explain it in full detail, but more or less, people's faces and bodies would look all twisted every couple of seconds. It stays for most of the first fifth of the movie, then is only occasional after that. But then there's blocking and many more problems that make up for it. You'd think with a direct to dvd release, they could at least get something right. The audio fares a little better, but everything's weird once again. While you can hear the audio just fine, it's almost too loud at times, and incredibly, all the actors' lines look like they're dubbed- especially Jennifer's. This becomes very obvious halfway through the movie when Archie yells at Sam. The camera is behind Archie so we can see the back of his head talking to Sam, but when he yells, his mouth doesn't open. Special features? None. Though the box tries to claim that a chapter selection, previews, spanish subtitles, close captioning and Dolby 5.1 are special features, we all know better than to fall for that. At the very least I expected some behind the scenes interviews or something with everyone going on about how great it was to work on a movie bound for failure. Is there any reason to buy The Truth About Love? Not at all. I guess that phrase "low expectations lead to better results" does ring true for it. I just wish the director, writers and actors had put a little more effort into everything. But you know the funny thing? I'll bet twenty bucks that this thing gets remade in a year or two with A-list actors (sorry Jennifer), and finds success after they rewrite all the boring parts. Even as a date movie, there are many better ones out there. Might I suggest Shaun of the Dead 
I'll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80's slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason. Jason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties. You don't go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they're slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It's basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance. Characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I'm like "damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. "We love premarital sex!" is so classic, as well as "it's okay, he just wanted his machete back!". Granted they won't make an AFI list but they made me laugh. It's the kind of movie that you probably weren't supposed to like: it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun. Just wish it was better 
I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this "feature" to anyone. "Eight Crazy Nights" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch "Ishtar," you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest. 
Let me start by saying if you are considering purchase of this film, make your own decision as to if you will purchase it. This is simply my opinion of the film. This movie has horrible fight scenes that don't appear to be martial arts at all. Basically, Van Damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities, and forces him into a stiff choreographed position. They found some buff guys, okay, big deal. They put them in a film, and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills. These guys don't have that. Vin Diesel has far better choreography by himself. I have said this about other films and I will say it about this one as well. The cast crew benefited from the production of this film, so it doesnt affect them. They go home happy believing they did a good job. You, the consumer, you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it. Wrong move as for this film. You will waste money that could have been put into your retirement, or used to buy your children school paper as they educate themselves. Save that money and put it where it belongs. This is not worth your cash 
this 1988 gore film (i can't call it anything else since it's not a horror film in the classic sense) features an ensemble of Treat Williams {most notably from the Substitute series of movies} and comedian Joe Piscopo, known for his years on Saturday Night Live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of Frank Sinatra and David Letterman among others. The two play cops, Williams is Roger and Joe is his partner, Doug. the back of the VHS gives a detailed description of the film, plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie. Lindsay Frost plays the stereotypical innocent woman caught up in everything that's going on around her...but the corpse of the situation deals with Roger getting shot and coming back to life. he must solve a case within so many hours or he'll turn into ashes...and as the hours progress, naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally. Darren McGavin plays the part of an evil doctor. Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but Dead Heat IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor 
As usual with a Bruce Willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was. Interesting high-tech house and mostly believable small-town villains who are the hostage-takers. The underlying story of the rich dad his swindles detracted from it I think 
This is, as most critics agreed, the best of the trilogy. Abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish, including a few twists along the way. I was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film. The only thing I DIDN'T like.... the short pause in the middle of the film, probably for a change between the dual layers. VERY annoying! 
The biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions. Witch Hunter Robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime. I didn't like it; I found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so-that's-it?' ending I hated. The animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky. Good visuals don't make up for bad story though. This serious drama geared is towards adults, and not children. If you like dramatic build-up that delivers, humor, or romantic comedy give this a pass 
Ok, I am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as " Vampire Assassin" then I run into another bad movie. Lets face it, this movie totally blows. And what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects? What was Eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie, she wasn't even the main star. More like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it. Please rent this one 
Viewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time. Many of those films that stand the test of time are from the Fantasy genre, including Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. Would I add Neverending Story to that list? Hell no. The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and "effects" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later. The story and plot had the potential to be interesting, but the execution makes Neverending fall flat. And sure, Neverending Story may have advocated reading in the mid-80's, but Labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics, which is the next step up for mind expansion 
The first set was very entertaining--a spy/crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by Moore and Curtis--Set II is another kettle of fish altogether. The second set is strictly played for laughs--there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin. Frankly, I hoped for more. For those who wish to obtain a true collector's set of this highly entertaining series, would do better to purchase the Network DVD Megaset Special Edition of The Persuaders, now available thru AmazonUK with some delighful extras including bumpers, promotional materials, episode commentaries, tv spot interviews, title sequences, and hour-long interviews with director, Robert Baker, Tony Curtis, and Roger Moore. Tony Curtis' unabashed comments regarding the production team, guest-star Joan Collins's antics on the set, and his marijuana bust en route to London for the taping of the first episode, are absolutely priceless in this Network DVD set. Surprisingly, the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the A set are written by none other than Terry Nation--who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series SURVIVORS in the UK four years later-when will that be available in the US? 
i went into this DVD with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it. maybe "enjoy" isn't the right word, it is intense, it is political (and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics)and it jumps around from subplot to subplot. in fact, i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks. but I found it very plausible. and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out. it succeeds here. it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence. Sure, it makes the Gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them, but that usually makes for a good starting point, since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway. I once heard a history professor say " it isn't about the struggle of good vs evil, it is always about the struggle of good vs good....both sides always think they are right and God is on their side"..... Watch it, you will come out the other side thinking. 
I bought 2 Barbie DVD and this is one of them. It's dark and scary at the beginning and the story line is not that great compare with the other one I have (Mermaidia). It doesn't attract my daughter like Mermaidia and she doesn't like it that much. Don't buy this. Get the Mermaidia one 
There's only one word to describe this movie: suhweeeeeeeet! Despite the dozens of imitators, Bloodsport was the first and best of its kind. From the classic training sequence where young Frank Dux masters the martial arts (and receives the katana he coveted as a boy), to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques, to the repeated chanting of "Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te!" on the pounding soundtrack, there's hardly a moment that won't have you pumped and calling for more. The only parts that don't quite work are the chase scenes and a young Forest Whittaker, who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in. But they don't detract from the main attraction: bone-crushing, blood-spattering beatdowns, and plenty of 'em. This is a quintessential guys' movie, and if you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to check it out 
where do I start? jack nicolson is a magnificant actor. He can play anybody and his performance in this film was top notch. I recomend anyone that claims to be a fan of his to check this film out. I guarantee you will be satisfied 
If you love John Waters then you're already right there with me. I would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie Grease but is a more self-aware film. I love rooting for the Drapes and the idea that the Squares can become Drapes, which, thematically, seems to be a Waterian theme - that we can all get along if we have sex with each other. Which is probably true John. Oh yeah, and Johnny Depp is young here and cool and I think you will enjoy seeing both Ricki Lake and Tracy Lords and Willem Dafoe as well (I know I did) 
Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) is an unusual child. As a baby, a bumbling fairy godmother named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gave her the gift of obedience. Every time anyone gives her a direct command, she must obey. Despite, or maybe because of, this "gift," Ella grows to be a headstrong woman. She goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres, giants, and elves. Current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only. But Ella campaigns for their equality. She is also one of the few women in the realm who doesn't swoon at the site of Prince Char (Hugh Dancy). When the two meet accidentally, Char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman. Trouble is brewing at home, however. Ella's stepsister Hattie (Lucy Punch) has figured out Ella's secret. Now, Ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do. So she leaves home and sets out to find Lucinda to give the gift back. I had missed seeing this movie in the theater, and finally got a chance to watch it. I missed a real treat. The movie is funny from start to finish, and I had a grin on my face the entire time. While the story is a bit predictable, it isn't super preachy. The cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life. The only drawback to the movie is the special effects. While some worked well, most of the time they weren't up to today's standards. While the main audience might be teen girls, this is one adult male who loved it. It's sweet, charming, and entertaining. What more could you want 
Well I thought it was going to stop at Volume 1. But, I guess it didn't. But, I am amazed that some of the cast is still living. I can't believe that Skip Hinnant who plays Fargo North Decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health. Not to mention Jim Boyd who plays J. Arthur Crank is also still alive but on the heavy side. As for Judy Graubart, I can't believe how old and skin and bones she is. She must've been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today. Hattie Winston poor thing, I think she must've suffered a stroke or something cause I've noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then. We hardly ever see Morgan Freeman in any of these interviews because he's a big time busy actor. But, I loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of DVD's from a show I grew up watching when I was 10. Luis Avalos who I loved watching not just on the Electric Company but in his acting career in movies like Stir Crazy and then a full role in Dom DeLuise's HOT STUFF along with his family. Luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like Jim Boyd. It is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories. It is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like Letterman are Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Joan Rivers, and Mel Brooks. You wouldn't have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today. Well now we have to get ready for Volume 3.....will there be? ......Let's hope so, cause I will surely buy it! 
This late Keaton material - when the actor desperately needed funds - is so asinine and unoriginal you will writhe along with Keaton rolling in his grave at this release. The cover art was so deceptive that I bought into the DVD collection being some obscure works from the silent era. Nope. The producers of this release went to painstaking steps to conceal the nature of this material. It comes from Keaton's last gasp on the screen: skits so insanely stupid you will pity both Keaton and yourself for buying this crap 
Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story. Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine 
These dvd's are a joke. If you want the ORIGINAL full length movies on dvd go on ebay. You will find versions copied from LASERDISC. They are in widescreen, digital quality, original audio and full length. They are superior to the old VHS Copies and much better then these new Dvd's. Viva la revolution......... 
Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it 
Excellent series. The court room scene is hilarious. I am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti Americanism of this series (I refer to the portrayal of the American guest) as well as in Upstairs Downstairs? In both series, as in other British TV dramas, Americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic. What about the Henry James/Edith Wharton type aristocrats who toured England in the 19th century? Mr. Hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them. When will series 2 be released 
This is the best film I've seen in perhaps six months or more. The direction by Turkish/Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is consistently interesting, intriguing, beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually. The film is beautifully cut, and the acting, particularly by the fascinating Giovanna Mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also Giovanna, is first rate. The story begins in a bakery during World War II when Davide Veroli (Massimo Girotti) is a baker's apprentice. We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment. But he is pounced upon by the baker. They wrestle, a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on Davide's hands as he runs out into the streets. Cut to modern times as Giovanna and her working-class husband, Filippo (Filippo Nigro) are crossing a bridge in the city. They meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented. He can't remember his name and he has no identification. Filippo takes pity on him and against his wife's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment. We know because of the man's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from World War II. But his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about Giovanna's brief affair with the man next door, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whose apartment window faces hers. This is a love story, a bitter-sweet one--which all great love stories should be in some sense, since life itself is bittersweet. It is framed by, and contrasted with, another love story, that involving the older man from many years ago. The tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married Giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city. Will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man? Because the police can find out nothing about the old man, and because Giovanna's heart softens toward him, and because he is an elegant man of refinement, especially in the pastry arts--Giovanna's dream is to be a pastry chef--the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship, the old man and the young woman. That's enough of the plot--the development, the denouement, and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense. Instead let me say that the feel of modern Italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present. The dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films. This is the first film directed by Ozpetek that I have seen, but it won't be the last. But see this for Giovanna Mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen 
Here we go again. Another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots. The differences between season 3 and this drivel are STAGGERING. They must have swapped out writers or something. How else do you explain the camera lingering on Lana Lang's MANY revealing showers for no reason? Let me say this as clearly as I can: Showing skin on Smallville doesn't work!! Good Points: Michael Rosenbaum is still the best Lex Luthor ever put on film. Sarah Carter as Alicia Baker is back! She's Clark Kent's interim girlfriend, like a psycho Lori Lemaris (who cares if she tried to slice n' dice Lana last season and it makes NO sense for Clark to be within 50 miles of her? I don't). There are two new supporting characters this time, Lois and, erm...Jason. I weep for Jensen Ackles. He's way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role. The way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like Lana's New Boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something. Erica Durance as Lois: EASILY the worst actress, and her lines don't help. I don't really mind, because Erica LOOKS like Lois, even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance. I think Lois would work better if she just STAYED in Metropolis and we saw her only through Chloe. But I guess it's cheaper to keep her on the regular set. Personally I think it's a conspiracy to give Allison Mack less screen time. Why doesn't she get a revealing shower? Bah. ****THINGS THAT MAKE MY BRAIN HURT:**** 1.) Clark (somehow) becomes a quarterback for the football team. You get to see it for five episodes. What drama. Ok, this is just stupid. He's CHEATING, OK?? It's CHEATING. He can't just switch off his powers when he wants to. Clark's football career also results in the episode "Recruit", which is hazardous to your health. 2.) Turns out Lana's part-witch. I thought she was Native American? Nah, just French. And a CRINGE-worthy villain. 3.) PRODUCER: "Hey, doesn't this show remind you of Charmed?? WRITER: "Not really, but great idea!! Lets dress Lois, Lana, and Chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers!" 4.) If the writers weren't going to keep Jason around for more than one season, why put him in the credits?? Durr. 5.) Jane Seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in TV history. She does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck. Bye. 6.) 'Jynx', 'Spell', 'Recruit', 'Sacred', 'Spirit' and 'Ageless'. Oh right, and 'Forever'. ALL LAME! They make me ashamed to watch the show! Some are so awful I don't think I've ever watched them more than once. That's like HALF the dvd set. Bah. Oooohh, I wonder if Clark and Lana are gonna get together this season! Just they like get together and break up EVERY season! I'm on pins and needles! The ONLY things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes. Oh yeah, Hey writers, stop ripping off other successful shows and movies! Morons 
Director: Turi Meyer Cast: Tony Todd, Donna D'Errico, Alexia Robinson, Jsu Garcia, Mark Adair-Rios, Lupe Ontiveros, Elizabeth Guber, Rena Riffel, Ernie Hudson Jr. Running Time: 93 minutes Rated R for bloody violence and gore, sexuality and language. The third in the series derived from a concept by Clive Barker, "Day of the Dead" (they can't even come up with their own subtitle) staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the "Halloween" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies: that is, taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet. The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish. Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror. Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him. There's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first "Candyman" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests. The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D'Errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically. Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach. The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different. Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he's right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage 
All Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty) 
I have to say I had no expectations going into this movie, I watched it with an open mind, ready for anything. What I got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to Wales, but also made me want to wail for hours because It was a waste of time. I am just confused about the whole thing really, the plot the characters the ending.....I see other reviews on here about how "creepy" it was, and I just didn't feel that. What I felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by Maria Bello (who I have never thought had a face or talent for acting) What they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane, where the dead go, and we can get the dead back if we give something living. The daughter is whisked away like Penelope taken to Hades but with much less interesting results. The mother and father, now have to take care of a displaced spirit child, her haunted freaky father, and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice Ikea blanket for me. Are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter, goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously na�ve and gullible local folks? (Who worships in an abattoir? C'mon people) none of these folds deserved children, much less a ghost one. So when the mother realizes that she sucks, and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care I didn't really care, I was thinking the girl was much better off. I was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it, what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father, because her daughter asked her too? Um, maybe what's wrong in this family is that No one communicates!!!!! Oh, wait, they all flipping know Morse code so that's enough?!?! There aren't any genuine scares, and sheep with glowing eyes aren't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it. The ending , both of them, didn't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together, it felt rushed. I don't understand Hollywood's obsession right now with creepy children, it's an echo of the days of "the bad seed" and "the omen" but not homage, more like terrible copycats with no "oomph". So see this movie If you like Sean Bean, he is the only good thing about it, other than that see it to cheer when Maria Bello hurls herself off a cliff. 
this film had a few laughs but was pretty run of the mill. Pauley Shore pretty much did the same role over but this film had a alright charm to it for a few minutes. i saw it again recently after some years had the same vibe to me then as now 
The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent. I won't bore you with the list. All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake. Tell us something new. The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line. A disappointment. 
I love TNG, DS9, and I even quite like a few of the characters in Enterprise. But I HATE Voyager. Why? One simple reason - Janeway. I cant stand her. She makes me want to puke. She has only two personas in the entire 7-year series and she constantly alternates between them, and they are both nauseating. First, vomit-inducing Compassion-face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper. Two, tough-chick-face in which she puts on a hard-chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard-chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable. God she nauseates me. The same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher. The one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything. Unlike Kirk, Picard, Sisko and even Archer, Janeway has no charisma at all. Yuck. But shes not the only one, this has got to be the only Star Trek series in which no matter how hard I tried I could never develop any attachment to the characters. They're all boring. Only Paris has any appeal and even then not much. I watched the first 3 seasons hoping I would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up. Years later I finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years. No. The same old nauseating Janeway, same old boring episodes, spewing over with self-righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality'. And this series is the most mushy, sentimental crap of all the Star Trek series. There is barely an episode that is not cringe-inducing in its emotional mushyness. The only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'Q2' episode and that was only because Q was in it (and they even turned that into a morality play), and the very end of 'Renaissance Man' when the Doctor tells Harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded Targ. Good riddance Voyager, and especially good riddance Janeway 
I was really looking forward to movie. My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period. Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching. My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors. They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers. Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed. As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more. I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment. I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time. Maybe it got better (that is why I gave it two stars) but I find that doubtful. I am wondering if both Tom Berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of Script Writing 101. 
I found this film accidentially on Amazon and was curious because I know Welles didn't complete a great deal of films. His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer. The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad. It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly. I did not shell out of the Criterion edition, which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film 
I recently discovered this set available on DVD and was very excited, since I've been a fan of David Suchet, Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot for a long time. I was really looking forward to viewing these, however the poor quality of the image was apparent to me in the first scene and it didn't get better. The image quality is actually worse than what I've seen on aired on television via cable. The picture appears to be composed of thousands of tiny vertical lines, which are easily discernable and difficult to ignore. I'm amazed Acorn would release such a great series in such a low quality package and then charge so much for it. I will definitely not buy any other titles by Acorn Media 
The Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood's worst movies. It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly didn't want to even finish it. Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies, it stands out as being a real stinker. Here Eastwood plays a loser of a cop, Ben Shockley, who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in Las Vegas for a trial. He's told it's a "nothing witness for a nothing case" so he thinks it'll be an easy assignment. Well, poor Shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness. It seems some conspiracy is afoot. The rest of the movie is Shockley, and his female witness, Gus Mally, running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes. And plot is so ludicrously predictable it's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is. Unless you really, really like Clint Eastwood, this is one to forget. I'll bet he wishes he could. 
Both sides of Disc 5 are unplayable. All others are O

the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin 
Highly enjoyable tale of the life of Marty Maher, the Irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become West Point's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years. Despite personal tragedies, and through two World Wars, Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers' academy, including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage, Irish accent intact all the way. The scenery and West Point pageantry is fun to watch (although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio -- but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the Military Academy). Interestingly, there's not really all that much football in this film -- there's a little, but it's mainly the story of Maher and his family, and the young men he came to love like his own sons. With the flame-haired Maureen O'Hara as Maher's Irish wife Mary, giving a radiant performance. Sentimental in that '50s way, of course, but the legendary director John Ford (working with a cast made up of many of his favorites) always puts a bite behind the sweetness 
Any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie). Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up. Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here. "Sahara" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy. It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask "how," because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score). Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes. Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas. Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region. However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent. Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way. These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner ("Thoughtcrimes"). The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the "Panama," which comes relatively early in the film. I want to ask, "Whatever happened to saving the best for last?" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in "Raiders of the Lost Arc," so why should that happen here? Granted, "Sahara" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than "National Treasure," probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality). Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film. I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film. For me the end result is that "Sahara" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety. But if you want more, then look elsewhere 
Actually not going to be kind........... What a load of RUBBISH 
The show is not so funny it repeats itself and it has too much music, dancing and intros for my favour. Watch instead mad t.v. or the chapelle show 
Robert Preston is the best Professor Hill. This is definitely a classic keeper you want in your collectio 
Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe 
Bearing in mind that the 50 MOVIE PACK line is what it is, no-frills packages of public-domain films, I have to say that SCI FI CLASSICS is not up to the level of MYSTERY CLASSICS and HORROR CLASSICS, which I also own. I've watched everything in the MYSTERY and HORROR sets, and, while the latter is padded with flicks that properly belong in the former, I didn't feel cheated by either. Moreover, some of the films included, such as DETOUR, IMPACT, BLUEBEARD, and TOO LATE FOR TEARS, actually are classics of a sort, deserving of repeated viewings. Only about 36 of the 50 films included in SCI FI CLASSICS remotely qualify as science fiction or even as "sci fi" -- and the only "classics" among them are famous (or infamous) anti-masterpieces on the order of ROBOT MONSTER, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE, MESA OF LOST WOMEN, and SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS; the balance comprises sword-and-sandal strongman epics, e.g., HERCULES AND THE TYRANT OF BABYLON, and jungle epics, e.g., WHITE PONGO, QUEEN OF THE AMAZONS, and Clyde Beatty's LOST JUNGLE. If you simply must have copies of low-budget programmers such as UNKNOWN WORLD, HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND, and THE INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD on hand for those occasions when THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL doesn't ring your chimes, you'll like this package. Otherwise, beware 
This presents us with a visual voyage into music that, in my opinion, excels that if the original Fantasia. Not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid, colorful, and highly diverse from segment to segment, but the representation of the music is, in itself, sheer genius. As I have come to expect from Disney, at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure. This much, I believe, is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music 
WOW. This movie is outrageous. It was a great movie for both Ice Cube and Mike Epps. They were both great in Next Friday, so I was ready for this movie. I recommend this movie to those who enjoy comedy with their action. There is a lot of both here. I also recommend Friday After Next, because Ice Cube and Mike Epps are in that as well 
Good introduction to Qigong. Mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful. Overall relaxing and precise. 
This cartoon gives me the entire memories when i use to watch them as a little kid.The DVD may not have the great special features,But if you ever see this sucker available in a store don't think about it just buy it 
Just as I remember it when it first came out in the eightys. Good movie but got little recognition, my wife who is 10 years younger than I had never heard of it, but was impressed 
I really enjoy both Nathan Lane Matthew Brodderick. I'm a marginal fan of Will Ferrell (in this movie, I thought he was *way* over the top). And it seems, nothing in this movie/musical really gels. I knew Nathan Lane sings really well, and was actually pleasantly surprised at Matthew Brodericks singing voice. Not pitchy at all - good voice. But the plot was lame slow. The songs didn't flow well. And, I belived it was too much "stage" and not enough of a movie. And, I didn't really find it that "dark" (even though that's how this movie was advertised). Mild satire maybe, but nothing near dark. It's more accurately described as bland! Frankly, nothing in it worked for me. It was a big disappointment. If you're *really* into musicals, then you might like it just for the singing - that's the only reason I stuck with it for the first 45 minutes. Maybe my grandparents would like it... I don't know. I'm somewhat confused by the positive reviews here. But I just had to shut it off - there was nothing advancing the plot or the characters, so I just didn't care how it ended. 1 star for the plot, 1.5 stars for the screenplay, 2 stars for the singing 
I remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things: 1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! 2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named "Alafair" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: "I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!" To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead. 
I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in "You Got Served" and was extremely disappointed. The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know. The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video 
Pearl Jam used to be good, now they're just a joke and this DVD shows it. Do not buy this its awful. They were great until after 1998 
This truly is a horrible movie. 7 seconds, huh, yeah 7 seconds to realize I made a mistake in renting it. The acting is horrible, the plot is horrible, the filming is horrible... Everything is horrible! I was hopeful because of Snipes, which is why I rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters. The guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie! Snipes couldn't even do the fight scenes and make them look real. The ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love! Huh, they were a romantic interest? They hinted at it, but never showed this happening. Do not rent or buy this movie. Stay away, or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie 
i had high expectation on the video but it turned out to be quite disappointed and boring, i have to say that the one is one of my favourite books i ever rea 
I loved the movie it has a lot of hidden symbols, like Almodovar is accustomed to doing. However, the music was the best 
This movie is one of the best movies to ever grace theatres! I think everybody is wrong when they say that the additional footage is not worthy and should be in the special featres menu because one of my favorite parts , which is when Vivian tells Edward that she wants to stop into the club to see her best friend/roommate and runs into her pimp boyfriend Carlos. The extras are fabulous and couldn't be better. So pick up a copy of this movie toda 
This film is a real delight, but it also has a message about our consumer culture. Don't miss the deleted scenes: I'm sorry the director cut out the "saints in the loft" in particular -- what a powerful image! But it's there on the DVD -- so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film 
Metropolis,Fritz Lang's 1927 silent masterpiece,is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one! But over the years,this film has been reedited,recut,and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker.Since its stay on the Public Domain shelf,the prints and image quality have over the years been poor.I DO NOT recommend the following versions:1.the Goodtimes Video release has poor image quality and even worse,NO MUSICAL SCORE! 2.The now-notorious Madacy DVD, which is about 5 times as worse as the Goodtimes video release,contains horrible,blurry image quality,freeze-frame opening titles,and an annoying musical score! Just recently,TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has broadcast the brand-new,beautifully restored 2002 restoration of Metropolis which I taped off of and trust me,it's well worth it! Buy the Kino restored version on either VHS or DVD,but DO NOT buy the horrible Public Domain versions which can definitely rip you off! A Terrific film and thanks to Kino for making this restored version a definite must-see! I also recommend the 1984 rerelease by Giorgio Moroder (which is now unfortunately out-of-print)and buy the soundtrack to go with it 
All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place. Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized. Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls? Maybe all the good directors have retired or died! What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end. In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-) 
It is a wonderful complement to my Lucy collection. The Tango scene is some of her best physical comedy!! 
CBS's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it's interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC's "SURFACE" and ABC's "INVASION", was cancelled. Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars. Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb? Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube's "reality" shows and less than funny comedies. Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting? Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters. Sadly, they didn't have the opportunity to finish the job. Was it cancelled because it didn't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes? Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios. So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated? Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn't appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.). Is it worth buying or renting? Yes. Though a cancelled series, it has that one thing most of it's one season wonders don't have--an adequate conclusion that doesn't leave you wondering how a cliff-hanger is to be resolved 
It is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action-comedy hybrid, however it just doesn't work. The action scenes seem tacked-on and the gags just don't work. 
Death Tunnel began with promise. Early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals, wonderful music, and a good feel. Them the actors opened their mouths and Death Tunnel fell apart. Death Tunnel is the story of 5 college girls who, seeking an initiation into a party clique, are picked into a hazing ceremony which leads them to an old hospital where white plague victims were slaughtered. The building holds much more than they suspect, including angry (and dull!) ghosts. From here the madness ensues and the blood flows. Death Tunnel drags after the first 30 minutes, and holds few frights. The story gets dull once the girls are trapped, for nothing really happens other than 45 minutes of filming tricks. During this time we are tortured with an abundance of horrible acting; some of the worst in an horror film I have seen this year. The acting leaves you scratching your head, wondering how any film studio will give a director/producer $2 million to make Death Tunnel and allow them to squander the money on junk talent. And in the end, that is what kills Death Tunnel: pitiful acting. The acting is scary, the movie isn't. Run away from this stinker. Run very, very far away and don't look back. Total Score (out of 100) = 18 11 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film. 0 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting? 2 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story? 5 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years? 0 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting? 0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase 
Robert Wiene's "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism. While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success. Francis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story. A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival. The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt). Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis's friends. Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events. In a strange way, one can look upon "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" as a bizarre version of "The Wizard of Oz" (1939). The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity. Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is stiff and dreary. The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in. Give "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar. 
"Office Space" is a very funny comedy. Many parts of the film were a delight. In the beginning, when everyone is stalled in traffic, I knew the feeling. Working at Initech Corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston). Besides having a job he hates, he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is. Then there is his boss Lumbergh--an arrogant jerk. Life for Peter Gibbons is just one boring day after another. That is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion [and demands] of his then girlfriend. While undergoing hypnotic suggestion, the psychologist dies of a heart-attack. But Peter is now a changed man. He no longer cares about his job, and says whatever's on his mind. And his boss Lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new Peter. When Peter learns of the impending layoff [courtesy of John C. McGinley and his partner] at Initech Corporation, he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus. His two fellow co-workers and friends are only too happy to go along: afterall, they're part of the layoff's. And on top of that, the company men want to make Peter a supervisor. This film is funny on many levels. With Jennifer Anniston as the love interest of Peter, and the character actors that make up the film--it makes for an enjoyable watch. Jennifer Anniston's character and her dealings with her boss and his "FLAIRS" are also funny. This is a highly recommended comedy. I'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between Peter and his boss Lumbergh. And the character of his boss Lumbergh is delightfully hilarious: Especially the way he talks. The whole movie is very funny and wonderful. Highly recommended. 
If you have never been introduced to Thora Birch-this is the one to see. I don't know if this was her first movie or not but she is really young in this film. If there were ever a star born "this is it". She is just unbelievable. Griffin and Johnson are really great too. This movie is actually worth watching for the scene location alone 
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director.to bad this one isn't a very good story. this mess came out at the heigth of the "slasher" movie frenzy. but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also. the theme of 4 kids who,now hold on here,think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival. before you can say "please kill me" the "thing" is picking them off one by one. with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen, but no, they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins. this bore last to long 
Subtitled guy's mom is sick. The guy is also depressed. Meets a ex-hustler on beach. They kiss, fight, make-up, over and over.(most of the movie) They break up. Boy meets hustler's ex and they play with dog on beach. The End 
This movie sucks! It is fake, everything is staged. Chicks dont laugh when they fight, nor do they dress like strippers! 
This was one of the best movies of 1998, but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience. When I try to think of superlatives to desribe it, the one that keeps coming to mind is "cool." Most of the coolness factor is owed to two things: Steven Soderbergh's steady directing and the chemistry between the actors, especially George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Back before we knew that Clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles, he defined suave in this movie. And back before she was J.Lo, Lopez was that IN LIVING COLOR fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress. Here she gives the best performance of her career. While all of the cast (Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks and Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in cameos) is solid, after Clooney and Lopez the real star is Don Cheadle. He is quite convincing as the prison boxer Snoopy. He oozes rage and steals every scene that he's in. Plots based on books by Elmore Leonard tend to be above average, but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes. Thanks to the talent of all involved, this movie is one of the best 
My wife and I saw "Love Actually" when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly. Yes, Richard Curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings, but it works. And the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in. When the movie first appeared on HBO, I always seem to find it and couldn't stop watching until the end of the movie. I bought the DVD and it's become a family tradition to watch it Christmas Eve (most years). And it never gets old. I am not a fan of Christmas movies. I've never seen all of "Miracle on 34th Street" or "Its a Wonderful Life", but I'm looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch "Love Actually" again 
I am a big fan of the book and thought the film version did it justice. Beautifully filmed; excellent performances

I first saw the movie poster and wasn't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler. But then I heard composer Alan Menken (who had worked on Beauty The Beast and Aladdin) was attached and this made me rethink my position. Then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before. Still, I went into the movie theater ready to give "Home On The Range" a chance... ...and fell asleep. I found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak. I admit the animation is fine (but not spectacular) and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between. Apparently "Home On The Range" was meant to be released before "Brother Bear" but because of story issues it was delayed. I don't think it should have been made in the first place. It has also ruined the work laid out by "Brother Bear" for a new Disney renaissance. I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired, because not only is it terrible, but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney, a massive loss to the entertainment industry. The DVD has an audio commentary (with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster). There is also a behind the scenes featurette, games, art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves. 
Most people doesn't realize that this band SUCK'S!!!! I AM a "HARD-CORE ROCKER FAN" but please!! Is not because this band doesn't know how to play music or is fictional, is beacause it suck's!! The reason that Spinal Tap suck's is because of their bloopers in live-concert and most of all THEIR STUPID LYRICS!!!!! I mean: "YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, OR MAYBE YOU DON'T!!!!!??????" "LISEN, SHHHHH!! WHAT THE FLOWER PEOPLE SAY AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!?????" "THE CATS MEOW!!!???" "SEX FARM WOMAN!!!???" "BIG BUTTON!!!!??" "I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME EARDRUMS BLEED!!!!????" COME ON! PEOPLE!!!! Try to realize why this movie is sooo funny! BEACUSE ALL THE PEOPLE LIKE A BAND THAT IS PURE GARBAGE!!!!!! But don't get me wrong! I did enjoy this movie(documentary really) because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60's, 70's and early 80's. And their music is LOUD, FAST and HEAVY!!! Adios. 
When I purchased this DVD, I was hoping to get the complete picture- an unbiased presentation. From scratch I could sense what was to come. Bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this DVD. It is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted. What little was discussed appeared to be very tainted. I definitely did not expect National Geographic to come up with this kind of a DVD. I will definitely think TEN times before I purchase anything from them. Maybe they should just stick to wildlife/geography/ecology and leave history/religion/spirituality alone 
Most of the characters in this movie are great, the scenes, the costumes and everything but I didn't like the outcome of the story .. I felt Daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and I couldn't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl. To be honest I never liked Gwendolyn's character at all, she was selfish, self centered and annoying, yet towards the end I felt very sorry for her, after all she'd gone through for Daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them. It's just what you expect once you discover the jewish factor involved. 
This has got to be the biggest stinker in Denzel's long movie career, just after the oscar winning Philadelphia, he went on to star in this cult Sci Fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game, Russel Crowe also stars in this very, and i mean very bad movie. But hey, if you're a Sci Fi fan, watch this, but don't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars. On account, this movie didn't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the Hollywood critic, The Only Movie with Two Lead Star To Not Hit The Box Office. This low budget sleepy movie isn't worth watching, if you love Sci Fi, that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race, pick up a true 5 star Hollywood material like, 'A.I', 'Terminator' 'I', 'II', 'III' or Will Smith's new movie, 'I, Robot' 
It is unfair to judge a children's film by the same non-technical standards you would judge a film made for a more mature audience. That said, I had a difficult time figuring out the intended target audience for Disney"s "A Far Off Place", an odd mix of "Alaska", "Walkabout", and "Blue Lagoon". Since each of these films had a different target audience (children for "Alaska", adults for "Walkabout", and teens for "Blue Lagoon"), "A Far Off Place" suffers from a poorly matched and confused mix of story elements, the attempt to appeal to multiple target audiences ultimately makes it unappealing to all audiences. Despite some positive comments on this database, "A Far Off Place" did not impress audiences at the time of its 1993 release and has generated little interest since. Based on stories by South African writer Laurens van der Post, "A Far Off Place" is the story of three teenagers: Nonnie (Reece Witherspoon as a girl raised on South African game preserve), Harry (Ethan Randall as a visiting American boy) and Sorel Bok (as their young Bushman guide Xhabbo) who attempt to evade a gang of ivory poachers by fleeing into the Kalahari Desert. Ethan Randall is actually Ethan Embry from "Can't Hardy Wait". Although recommended for ages eight and up, most younger viewers will be deeply disturbed by the early scenes, where the family's idyllic life is ended by a night attack on their home by the poachers. The house is burned and the parents are murdered. And more mature viewers will be deeply disturbed by the next scene where Nonnie turns into Rambo and kills most of gang in a sequence credible only to a horrified eight-year old. At this point it begins to look like "Walkabout", a story of an Australian girl, her little brother, and a young Aborigine on his ritual journey to manhood. In a significant deviation from the book Xhabbo's wife does not accompany the group into the desert. "Walkabout's" more adult theme of interracial sexual awakening is replaced by a "Blue Lagoon" romance between the two white teenagers, a reflection of the film's narrower values and more modest ambitions. The scenes shot in the desert are almost the equal of "Alaska" for scenic beauty but "Alaska"s" more realistic survival challenges are superior to the blend of survival skills and mystic powers that Xhabbo demonstrates to his two companions during their journey. There is an element of "The Gods Must Be Crazy" in this clash of cultures but the film does not go very far (bad pun intended) with the concept. Both "Alaska" and "A Far Off Place" insert the element of poacher violence into the journey, to the detriment of the basic story. 'Walkabout" did not need this and found sufficient story material in the enormity of the survival experience. Bok is excellent as the young Bushman and Randall/Embry's performance is solid if unexceptional. Those interested in Witherspoon's early work would be better served checking out her great debut performance in "The Man In the Moon" and avoiding this career misstep. Those looking for a children/family story should stick with "Alaska". Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child 
I almost gave up on this one forty minutes in. Don't you do that. The ending is superb. Premise: working class girl gets dumped by her boyfriend and seeks work by housekeeping. Well, that can lead to something better if you keep house for the right person. Jacques (Jean-Pierre Bacri) who recently got walked out on by his wife, and who, not so incidentally looks sixty--well, fifty-five--(actually he was barely fifty when this was made, but you get the point) gets his ad for a housekeeper answered by Laura (Emilie Dequenne) who is twentysomething--a young twentysomething. I guess there is not much else to say, and to be honest I decided I would force myself to watch the inevitable. But the director is Claude Berri who directed two of the best movies I ever saw: Manon of the Spring (1986) and Jean De Florette (1986). And so I stayed with it. At about the fifty minute mark the movie started to get interesting. I could feel that old guy/young girl love affair was going to take an unexpected fork in the road. (As Yogi said, if you come to a fork in the road, take it. The players have no choice.) Obviously, old guy/young girl can end only one way: young girl leaves old guy for young guy. This is biology. It will be painful. Claude Berri knows all this, and probably a lot better than I do. And so guess what? Well, I won't tell. But you will find that the last thirty-some minutes of this sexy romantic comedy delightful, and especially the very, very clever and most satisfying ending. Just prior to that Laura asks Jacques for his blessing. He won't give it, but she is right: he should. And then when we get the final "life is so...lifelike" grimace on Jacques's face, we can only smile. Emilie Dequenne is delightful as the strangely wise and very natural Laura, and Jean-Pierre Bacri is winning as the old guy who knows better, but on reflection should thank his lucky stars 
This movie has recieved several bad reviews and I can understand that. This movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical "first gay love movie", but if you like movies that are not, this one if a must have. The movie is not a hardcore sex movie, in fact there is only one scene of sex, in the movie. The positives of this movie are, it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love, one that doesn't turn out in the same way other movies portray. Again, I only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex 
My favorite DVDs are concerts, festivals, unplugged etc. I was going to buy the CD and Amazon pointed me to their DVD. I prefer DVD surround sound to CD stereo. Plus you get something to look at. I heard the Demon Days songs on the radio, and liked them alot. This is an excellent DVD. You may want to check out Bonnaroo, Cross Roads, String Cheese, even the Doobie Bros. Oh yeah and Eric Burdon and the New Animals 
I did not much enjoy this film, and I didn't find it very clever or funny. It's true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed. Along the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn't make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric? Laura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn't redeem this film for me 
Where do I start?? I am a 39 year old career-obsessed straight female (lawyer). I fell in love with these guys. Brian (Gale Harold) You are the James Dean of this generation, the man we love, adore, the badboy with a golden heart, who we all fall hopelessley in love with. Brian, Justin, Em,Micheal and Ted. I became absolutely besotted with them and their funny, sad unbelievable stories and watched fixated episode after episode. I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I lived the rollercoaster with them. Buy series 1, you will be hooked just like I was, I have now viewed all 5 and keep going over and over them. It dosent matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you represent. This series is wonderful, and funny and full of love and hope. Its appeal is absolutely universal for all us dreamers and lovers and geeks. Watch it, and weep... I promise you won't be disappointed. 
Stick with Ted Turners "Gettysburg", what can I honestly say about this work of fluff. Nothing 
Visconti's film is significantly different from Mann's classic story. Aside from the obvious changes (Aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer, etc), there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character. For example: In the book, Aschenbach's wife is dead, and his daughter is grown up and married away. In the film, his daughter dies in childhood, and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits Venice. Another reviewer here called the film "ambient"; I would add the word "poised." The camera lingers on scenes for many minutes; observations occur in planes of depth. The acting is often extremely subtle. The young man who plays Tadzio looks as if he is sculpted of alabaster. Compositions, lighting, settings, costumes and makeup are simply exquisite. Imagine if this had been photographed in 65mm! DEATH IN VENICE probably looks better here than it ever did in theaters. The DVD transfer is superb, based on what appears to be a spotless, pristine source. The wide Panavision aspect ratio is faithfully preserved, anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Sadly, the original monaural soundtrack has not been remixed for stereo; but execept for some occasionally muffled dialog (which may be intentional), it still sounds very good. The post-MTV generation will find this film tough going. Don't buy this if you're hoping to see police gondolas flip over and explode. : 
This DVD sucks, all the "fights" are fake, retarted, drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time I've ever had in my life. I am now stupider for watching this DVD and buying it is on my list of regrets I have in life. I wish I could say the only good part was.... but THERE WAS NO GOOD PART. No shirts ripped off or good hits thrown, nothing. I am a Marine stationed in Japan looking for a DVD to enjoy and this is what I get. Where is the love 
If your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of "End of the Century" or "Filth and the Fury" THIS AIN'T IT! Picture taking 40 hours of bad home video (really awful sound) and editing together and calling it a documentary. No current interviews, No voice over making any sense of the chaos...No thought to flow or storyline, just a mishmash of stuff banged together. A real dissapointment. The saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it, this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance. I've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due. Its a shame this is what its been reduced to. Shame on everyone involved 
For those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired, all I can say is that you won't be disappointed. This series is one of my all time favorite TV shows. When I discovered it was on dvd I snapped it up right away. The picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version I originally saw. This is the first TV series I have ordered on dvd and I was afraid the picture quality would be vhs. Boy was I wrong, this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd I have ever purchased. If you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series 
Absolutely terrible. The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook. Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging "comic" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too. ASAP 
RESPIRO is one of those Italian treasures of a film, this time written and directed by the insightful Emanuele Crialese, that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story. RESPIRO mixes the gut-level Italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by Fellini. Lampedusa is a Mediterranean island between Sicily and Tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of Italy to be a return to the native. The population is all involved in fishing. On this picturesque island lives Grazia (the beautiful and talented Valeria Golina) who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality. She lives happily with her fisherman husband Pietro and her children: teenage Marinella (Veronica D'Agostini), Pasquale (Frncesco Casisa - a very fine little actor!) and Filippo (Filippo Pucillo). The boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace. When Grazia's actions come under scrutiny by Pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother (Muzzi Loffredo) who occasionally gives Grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests Grazia needs psychiatric help in Milan, Grazia runs away to hide in a grotto, her whereabouts are known only to Pasquale. The little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of Grazia, only to discover on St Bartolo's Day that Grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean. How this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie: revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of RESPIRO. Suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away! This little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography - both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean - of any film you'll see. The music by John Surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric. The way director Crialese captures the folklore-like behavior of the youngsters' games, and the married-to-the-sea philosophy of the villagers, is utterly magical. This is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society. RESPIRO is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to Eden. In Italian with English subtitles. Grady Harp, November 200 
To enjoy Citizen Kane, you have to be able to answer the question above. I just hate almost everything about this film. I think it's easy to create a hype how such a terrible film look great and deep. Many people will fall for it. But it's very hard to make a truly GREAT FILM! 
This is easily one of the best films of the 80's. Kevin Bacon is a GOD in this movie. He plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil. When the Footloose song comes on the radio, my co-worker Tom and i cant help but busting into dance. Its films like this that can make you feel good and drunk with happy feet!! Buy this dvd for your collection and you'll be bursting into dance before u know it! 
An amazing film! Not only is it a fantastic adventure, but the story is well laid out. Just the right amount of special effects, great music and good actors. When seeing this movie at the theater I was not too excited, but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is. Not nearly as gory as Gladiator, but is similar in style. 5 out of 5 
ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film. I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity. but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth. take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better. so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one 
How I made it through this poorly executed, poorly written sequel, I have no idea. Catherine's in trouble again and people she meets are dying. Who's the murderer, Catherine, the shrink who lusts over her, or the cop who's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key? Catherine certainly gets around: She manages to befriend the most unlikely of people, all associates or ex-wives or enemies of the shrink, and most of them end up dead. Is she trying to drive the shrink nuts, or does she plan to kill him? This movie makes little sense: It doesn't thrill or tantalize. And it offers Sharon Stone in an unflattering light, as a cold seductress with little to offer but mindless sex. But then that seems to be her best role, doesn't it? It doesn't work this time around, and the only realism is in Stone's sneer: It looked all too natural 
This DVD exposes the Ultimate Warrior as 25% postitive and 75% negative. I do believe that Jim Hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis. Just another case of a wreslter who couldn't seperate himself from the character, and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges. The only thing that bothers me is that Jim Hellwig wasn't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions. He was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact. Jim Hellwig declined, used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit. This guy did make an impact in the wrestling world, but it was too shortlived. Fans can chalk it up as a cool memory, but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with Flair, Piper, Hogan, and the most respected of all The Undertaker 
it does tend to lurch, but I give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest; the end is not near, it is very, very near. and possibly, it has already come and gone 
Rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence, teenage angst, sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from Alexander Payne. Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range. Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality. In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty. One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election. Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she "can carry out his divine plan." Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win. ELECTION is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind. Enjoy 
First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said. Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good.. However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though.. This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD.. Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself. 
This is without question the worst movie ever made. It makes "Plan 9 from Outer Space" look like "2001". Roger Ebert must be a genius. No one could "accidentally" make a movie this bad. I guess it's a comedy - that is if you find the contents of a toilet funny 
Every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for Jack Ti Jean Kerouac! To actually see most of Kerouac's fellow writer's and poet's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated genius that was this brother Lowellian is in itself a magnificent production! I bought this DVD today at a mall in New Hampshire and could have bought it for less on Amazon.com! Just a few minutes ago I did order the DVD Jack Kerouac-King of the Beats on Amazon.com and can't wait for its arrival! If it's anything like What Happened To Kerouac? then it will surely be another masterful production! After I write this review I am going to watch this DVD again and experience the same chills as I did when initially watching it for the first time! Anyone that is a true fan of Kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius! To hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of Kerouac himself is truly awe-inspiring! This production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is: Jack Kerouac 
I love this movie. Great sequel, great characters, great gore. A must for all fans of the "Saw" movies. 
This is without a doubt the DVD to own if you wanna see how 5.1 should sound and how digital video should look. If you own an HD TV and have a 5.1 system you must have this. The crowd has been minimalized. Whoever directed this did a fantastic job, you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song. Incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there (Glass, sounds great). This is the best concert DVD out right no 
Well, I wrote the review about this set, and boy was I disappointed when I got it. I see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters. 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection. The transfers are terrible and the sound is worse. Come on guys, at least try to put some effort into it!!! I got the set, watched it and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use. What a waste of money!! 
Couldn't believe that this was the same John Lithgow who starred in "Third Rock From the Sun", an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on NBC. John plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by Denzel's character. Wasn't expecting much, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining. Yes, it was a little violent, and some parts were a tad unbelievable, but overall, Denzel and John were worthy antagonists. Boy, Denzel sure was gorgeous!! Still is. 
This story is one of the worst "fantasy" stories ever. It is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo-christian story line. Don't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to Lord of The Rings or Harry Potter for original (not to mention secular) fantasy and escape. 
I'm the biggest "Wuthering Heights" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they'll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided "Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I've seen thus far haven't really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it's a good enough movie (as long as it didn't have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn't showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than '92. Needless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn't EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most "Wuthering Heights" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there's many a kiss in the movie. There are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy "Wuthering Heights" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan 
I think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy I don't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim, especially about how it's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character? But being in a liberal arts college I have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following. The characters and the situations remind me of the short stories I would write in the sixth grade when I was around 12 years old, where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb, absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating, inane nonsense. The whole movie feels like ones 12-year-old self trying to write about adult problems that they're distanced from yet infatuated by. This movie appeals to the type of people who like to read Catcher and the Rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain-smoking, wannabe-depressed but more like "I'm so sad 'cause I don't have a girlfriend" indie-rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring. I think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing, it's unfortunate he can't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic "subtle" messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say. Hipster drivel - look for something else to watch 
If you love Adam Sandler's comedy, you'll adore this outstanding SNL compilation of the Best of Adam Sandler. It features all his best skits, and outlines how great and wonderfully talented this actor/comedian is. Also featured in this DVD are skits with the great Chris Farley, Mike Myers, and other great SNL stars. The only disappointment from this DVD is that it contains no special features. Best Skits: Zagats: This skit features Chris Farley and Adam Sandler playing an old couple who have to decide what restaurant they want to go to for their anniversary. This best displays Farley's comical brilliance, but we also get a great delivery from Sandler. Opera Man: Always a classic in the field of SNL. The Denise Show: A classic from Sandler, as he delivers a skit about an ex-girlfriend he can't forget about. Schmidt's Gay: A hilarious commercial of a homo-erotic beer featuring Sandler and Farley. Overall, this is a must-buy for any Adam Sandler fan as it features some of the best SNL skits of all time 
Excellent little known movie with Viggo Mortensen as an F.B.I. agent under deep cover to infiltrate Japenese Mob. Great performances by all {Michael Nouri, a little over the top} great action and sentimentality when Viggos character is torn between man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent after F.B.I makes deal with mobster Nouri to make a hit on the Yakuza 
Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. What a solid combination! Better than Fistful of dollars and I liked it better than the too long Good, Bad and Ugly. Van Cleef as bad guy? Sorry, I can't go for that 
this is by far the worst moive I've seen. I LOVE the first secret garden. No one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl. It's a classic. But this sequel is terriable. It controdicts the first moive. It takes the magic away. If you liked the origanl, first moive don't watch this, it will take the magic out of the first moive 
Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously. About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going. What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick? This is not one of his better films 
this is a fantastic video. I use it regularly for teaching. It gives a wonderful sophisticated view of chuck close as an individual and an artist, as well as a glimpse of the other artist's work who are interviewed in the video. It is filmed in a very immediate and personal style. There is nothing stiff, boring, or disconnected about it, common faults of many art videos. Anyone who has experienced a similar tragedy in their family will find the discussion of chuck's event very moving, and not at all sappy 
How sad and pathetic this concert is.I loved the Dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy.After seeing how good the Stooges reunion concert was I was hoping for more of the same ...wrong!!It becomes painfully clear from the start that Johanssen in particular is phoning it in.Low point of the show is when they make "Human Being" [one of the greatest rock-n-roll songs ever] a sing-a-long.Give me a break!!!! 
"The Medium" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005. I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in. However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating. Patricia Arquette who was in "Ed Wood" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois. Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in "Meet Joe Black" and plays her husband Joe is riveting. They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison's psychic ability. I found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show, I still wanted to watch them over episodes of CSI Miami that I had not seen. When I bought the DVD, I was hoping there might have been an episode I'd missed, but I'd seen them all between NBC Lifetime reruns several times. I'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing. Alison's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together. What impresses me about Alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing. In a world of violence, it's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points. In the episode "In Sickness Adultery" her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her. As she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife, she finds that her best defense is the truth. The two older daughters are also jewels. Maria Lark as Bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream, "Mom, please stop doing that!" Sofia Vassilieva as the older Aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing. David Cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of Detective Lee Scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with Arquette. Miguel Sandoval as the district attorney Manuel Duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show. (Perhaps we will sometime see more about his family.) While it's hard to pick my favorite first season episode, the complex plot of "A Priest, A Doctor Medium Walk into an Execution Chamber" is a jewel, with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder. The DVD commentaries and introduction to the real-life Alison DuBois really give excellent background for fans of the show. This is one show that reaches the level of art for me. Its excellence will make it memorable for a long time this DVD collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection. Bravo 
Joel Hershman's "Greenfingers", starring the now-famous (and utterly gorgeous) Clive Owen and Helen Mirren, is a sweet, cutesy, and utterly empty British romantic comedy. In this forgettable, generic chick-flick, inmates at a British minimum-security prison take up gardening. Initially, they are understandably reluctant to garden. But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives! And, after his parole, Owen's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden! And Mirren's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her! Wow, where do people get this stuff? Of course, this being a "romantic comedy" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren's daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other. In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed "uplifting moments". And none of it works. For all its good intentions, "Greenfingers" is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates' rooms. It's all perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull 
I grew up in Hannibal Mo, so I am very familiar with Mark Twain's writing and his humor. The make up is great as Holbrook even looks like Twain. Holbrook is a great story teller, and he uses the material well, and makes it wa wonderful program. I saw a perfomance live in NYC years ago, and another one in my current home town. Each time I see it again, it is still funny and a great performance 
Denzel Washington plays the legendary Steve Biko in this late-80's film, while Kevin Kline plays a top journalist who befriends Washington's character in South Africa. Denzel is my favorite actor, and although he doesn't get a lot of screen time, this is one of his strongest roles ever(and you know that's saying a lot). Not only does he nail down the African accent, but he portray's Biko's renown concern and persistence. This movie was awesome for the first hour. I could not take my eyes off it! As the inevitable came around this point, the movie turns to Kevin Kline's character who's trying to escape South Africa and spread Biko's story and message. It drags on quite extensively(the movie is over 2 1/2 hours) but it still maintains, enough to keep it's five-star rating in my book. There were some other flaws, like how quickly Kline's character switched from hostility to befriending Biko. That happened so quickly I couldn't tell when they actually saw eye-to-eye. The film was beautifully shot, especially for the 1980's, and I love the scene where Biko is speaking at an outdoor stadium being held up by dozens of supporters. Keep an eye out for Joseph Marcell(Geoffry the butler from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) who has a couple crucial scenes at the end playing a character aptly named 'Moses.' The reason this movie was so memorable to me was because it really got me thinking how oppressed black folks have been throughout history. Sure, other movies have depicted this and maybe display this better, but Sh##! To find out how black people were even kicked aside and discriminated against in South Africa was eye-opening! I am beginning to understand their frustration as a race, and even those in America, more and more. Seeing this movie, and being Caucasian myself, you get a sense of why the black brethren distrust the white man or see him as evil, and there's no propoganda or direct bashing of the white race in this film. Just depiction. I, myself, kind of feel like a jerk for what my race has done over all these years. And believe me, we may think this sh#t's resolved and straight today, but we got a long ways to go! You really gotta hand it to Denzel. He's tackled some of the biggest black icons so effortlessly, not only Malcolm X, Reuben Carter, among others, but Steven Biko as well. He may just be an actor, but he must have some strong beliefs in his own race as well to portray legends like these! It would be great to see him start speaking up for his people and directly to his people, a la Bill Cosby. I got this movie off Amazon because I could not find it in stores, but I recommend searching for it yourself or buying it however you can.. 
This series is awesome, and I am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over. It speaks to the depths of the soul of a man. Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series. This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles. The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional. I recommend this for any group of buddies, or even church groups 
In my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short's humor with the exception of, "Clifford". My then teen children and I spilt our sides laughing at Short's work when we first saw this film! Several times we laughed so hard at a scene; we couldn't go on until we replayed the scene several times over. We were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter! All three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored. Even if you are not a big fan of Martin Short; you will enjoy, "Clifford" 
this is entertainment? Wow, exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat 
Mission:Impossible, the TV series, told the adventures of the Impossible Missions Force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins, foreign dictators, terrorists and others who threatened the security of the United States. Rather than engage in James Bond-like shoot outs, the IMF team worked together to covertly neutralize threats, leaving little or no trace of their involvement. Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show. Along comes Brain De Palma's catastrophe of a remake, starring that couch-jumping Scientologist Tom Cruise. Within half an hour of the film starting, the entire IMF team, save for Cruise, is killed off, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original Mission:Impossible is shot to hell. Granted, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are present as Cruise's new team, but Mission:Impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another Tom Cruise vehicle where he preens and postures. Making a film called Mission:Impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original TV series. It's obscene what Tom Cruise's ego has done to Bruce Geller's original concept. This is just another action film with Mr. Cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself. See the original TV series and skip this piece of bastardized trash 
Of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of Allah on that day, this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching. Because of this, those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events. And perhaps none more so than "Caesar" in his review of Sept. 17, 2006. If only he found at least as troubling the carnage, bloodshed, and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his Islamic buddies against civilian populations. But, more on this in a bit. As regards this extraordinary video, from the perspectives of air traffic controllers, FAA officials, NORAD and NEADS, the air crews and passengers on board each of the four doomed flights, to the testimonies of the witnesses, participants, firefighters, and all the heroes on and near Ground Zero, this is the singular documentary that takes you minute by minute through the hell deliberately planned and perpetrated by those whose religion had them believing that the execution of such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven. (and no... this is not the "propaganda" or view of the documentary, but instead my own conclusions drawn on many years of personal investigation of Islam). Anyone who, like "Caesar" here, could watch this fully factual account and then call such a splendid documentary "goody-goody propaganda" "try(ing) to portray the US as good guys being hit by the bad guys..." reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-American hatred for so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors as the acts of "good guys" retaliating against "bad guys." While "Caesar" (how telling a nickname) attempts to school us ignorant Americans on our country's past political-policy foibles, yet he fails to mention the billions in financial and economic aid we have given the Islamic nations, the millions in military equipment and technical advisory assistance provided them as they struggled against invading Soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting to annex and rule over sovereign Islamic nations, the ousting from Kuwait of the brutal armed forces of an Islamic fascist dictator who had invaded and then "enjoyed" weeks of the metaphoric and all too literal raping in this tiny Islamic nation while openly looting, terrorizing, butchering, torturing, and murdering its citizens while none of its Islamic neighbors lifted so much as a finger to intervene, but instead begged the United Nations and the U.S. to solve their problems for them... which we did! And these are just a tiny listing of the far greater acts we have done for the cause of justice and good, and all of it on Islam's behalf. And yet, 9/11 is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre by which we continue to be repaid by the bloodthirsty religion of Islam for all we have done and continue to do on its behalf. "Caesar" also glaringly omits and all too conveniently ignores radical Islam's blood-soaked history and their on-going policy of religiously motivated bomb blasts, hijackings, kidnappings, tortures, rapes, gang rapes, female circumcisions, sawing and/or hacking off people's limbs and heads, mutilations, and always... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide, including those of their own religion, and all thanks to Islam's foundational tenets of blood lust that makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable, eternally rewardable, and thus... forever inevitable. True, all religions have their radicals and fanatics. But none deliberately attract, nurture, and encourage terrorist fanatics more than does Islam. And none preaches genocide against the entire Jewish race/nation and all non-Islamic "infidels" in the name of God more than does Islam. And it is how this video accurately documents for the entire world only this latest and greatest mass butchery in the name of Allah that probably motivates "Caesar" most to attempt such blatant anti-U.S. propagandizing here. And for those who would disagree, I challenge "Caesar" or anyone else to provide us any reliable evidence of even a single factual error in this documentary. What I think "Caesar" fears most is that such a powerful documentary as this might add to the growing world view that despite the constant rhetoric of Islam as a religion of "peace," the ever-escalating terrorist acts of its leaders and constituents in the name of Islamic religion reveal the exact opposite to be the true case. Maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking any religion that so encourages its hormone-driven young men to blow themselves up with as many "infidels" as they can so as to spend eternity in orgiastic sex with 72 virgins deserves to be fully prosecuted, at the very least on charges of "conspiracy to commit (mass) murder"! And one thought that just hit me: If more and more Islamics continue to either commit or condone such bloodshed and with the full approval of their Islamic leaders, which god are they truly honoring and emulating: Allah -- the Creator of Life; or instead, Iblis (Satan), the Destroyer of it? By their fruits are they known, after all. And on the question of whom and what Islamics most worship and adore, permit me to close this review as also does this wonderful documentary, by quoting one of Islam's most renowned clerics: "We love death. The U.S. loves Life. That is the big difference between us." -- Osama bin Laden 
The uncut version of the anime is much better than what is aired on TV. Though there are still some diferences between the Japanese version and what is in the uncut version. I wouldn't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core Naruto fan. The bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs 
My impression was: what a waste of money - why take such a nice play and do it like that? Why? - What's that "old lady"? What sort of character Mrs. Lupone built? I read the reviews here - and I didn't believe them. I should have had. But there are good moments though - imaginative, creative, although far from funny 
I was leaning towards giving it only three stars because it has certain weaknesses. But then I saw the ending, and it was a beautiful one. It always makes me happy to see love onscreen. The side story of a jealous rival geisha constantly hurting our hero was annoying. There really wasn't any reason for it. Another part of the story I found annoying was the lack of communication between the main characters. Our hero was giving one man all the signals that she was interested, but she in fact was interested in a different man, who she wasn't communicating with at all. I don't like having to witness problems that make no sense to me. But then came that surprise ending, so warm and affectionate. That was nice 
A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a "ripoff") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes). The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies. There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women. 
So this is the best I have seen from a terrible tradgedy. I watched with friends with tears streaming down my face. So factual and so sad 
This, as you may have already read, was a very intimate little show made to promote Morning View. The live footage is as good as it gets, and the sound is flawless to boot. This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there's that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous. A few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You. As amazing and funny as the special features are, the standout is really the performance. I can't find any words that would do this show justice. I guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself 
A family oriented film that is humorous, fun, exciting and very entertaining! After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to own it! It is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean. This is a must own for the family 
I was reading some reviews of "The Quiet Man" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren. In that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view. For me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston's skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur's best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ's ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur. Heston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius. I say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In "Spartacus," also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word. At the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston's face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase. A great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur 
This may be entitled "Warner Bros. Classic Holiday Collection," but Warner Bros. had nothing to do with the production or distribution of Boys Town, Men of Boys Town, or the 1938 Christmas Carol. Louis B. Mayer may return to haunt the Christmases of those heretics against the one, true religion of MGM, who purloined Spencer Tracey, Mickey Rooney, and Ann Rutherford to enrich the reputations of Harry, Jack, Abe, and Ted. 
I hear this is a good movie, but can't play it as the DVD is visibly damaged. So what about Quality control? This disc should never have gotten out the door, but the odd thing is, I ordered 2 DVD's from Amazon - different titles, both damaged. Are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us? "F 
Are you kidding me!? This movie is beyond all redemption. Sean Conery is a disgrace to himself, running around in a red diaper with pirate boots on. WTF! What's with all the naked women in this thing? Why do they have to be naked? They're hideous looking in the face and body. My God, my eyes! If this is the product of the "love" generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating, no wonder our society is crazy. I just can't get over how profoundly corny and simple the plot and effects are, it's downright insulting to the human brain. Whoever wrote this and was crazy enough to finance it, should be killed and then studied so we don't have another idiot of this caliber spawned 
It is movie about the strength of friendship and how three men carry out a promise to a dying friend.How men will fight to the end for a dream of one man.The characters drew strength from one another.It tells about the hardships of the old west.The unfortunate greed of men and how greed can kill.Tom Selleck's character showed the the ability to love a woman and his love of his friends.The other characters complimented each other.The movie was well worth the price.You will want more of the same 
Yes, I thought the Whoppi disclaimers were absurd (HOW many generations have grown up with these cartoons, and now all of a sudden they're "bad"?) I never saw disclaimers on CBS when I watched these cartoons on Saturday mornings for years and years!!! But aside from that, my main gripe is the organization. It would be better if they'd organize these into eras (I'm not as big on the Leon Schlesenger era from the 30s/early 40s as I am on the Fritz-era, and would rather these be organized chronologically. Not that I don't respect those early shorts for what they were, I just like the later ones better). Regardless, as long as they keep releasing these I'll still keep getting them, since Cartoon Network and Nickelodean have completely removed them and decided that the new generation of kids "don't have the attention span" to appreciate them (I beg to differ, my kids LOVE Looney Tunes!), and replace them with garbage full of toilet humor (which, apparently, is OK by the PC police... 
Dietrich Bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey. His books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues, but practical issues of the greatest moment. There is a great line in Kierkegaard, in the preface to THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH, where he writes: "Everything essentially Christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed; even if only medical experts understand it, it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person." What gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them, as he struggled to live out the implications of Christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so. Bonhoeffer was in so many ways a paradox and the documentary does a great job of showing this. Raised in a secular home, he inexplicably decided to become a theologian and pastor. At a time when a host of right wing movements were overtaking Germany, he espoused left wing political and social values. In an age of growing intolerance, he expressed a sympathy and understanding of both Jews and blacks almost unprecedented in the Germany of his time. And in an age when many theologians wrote academic works with little regard to how they should connect with real life, Bonhoeffer was obsessed with the connections between thought and practice. What is most impressive in studying the life of Bonhoeffer, whether through reading his books or Eberhard Bethge's great biography or watching this documentary is the man's fundamental goodness and dedication to doing what is right. If he had been catholic instead of protestant, he would surely by now have been declared a saint. He seems to have had the saint's calmness and peacefulness. One is certain that he slept the sleep of the just. Bonhoeffer was one of the most promising young theologians in Weimar Germany. Had he lived in more peaceful times he certainly would have written a host of first-rate theological works. Like his theological mentor, the great Karl Barth, who was himself the greatest theologian between Luther and Calvin and the present, he would have written works that explored the concrete role that religion must play in every day life. When Hitler rose to power, Bonhoeffer could easily have fled to the United States and taught through the course of the conflict and in fact had an appointment at Union Theological Seminary in New York, which he left to return to Germany. Moreover, he joined the resistance against Hitler and came to believe that it was his moral and religious duty to aid in the attempt to assassinate him. After an attempt to kill Hitler through the use of an air pressure bomb placed on a plane failed (for whatever reason it did not detonate as it should have), a host of suspected conspirators were arrested, including Bonhoeffer. He spent the rest of his life in a Nazi prison, dying at the hands of the Nazis only a few days before the American armies liberated the concentration camp to which he was transferred near the end. If one reads his ETHICS one is impressed by sections such as the one on what it means to tell the truth. Kant had famously argued that if a man that one suspects is angry enough to kill a particular person comes up and asks you where that person is, the moral law demands that you not lie to the would-be murderer (though in Kant's defense it isn't clear that we are obligated to tell him where the intended victim is, but merely that we not lie). For Bonhoeffer the situation is so much more complex. He knew about many facets of the conspiracy and merely refusing to answer the Gestapo's questions would have done much to confirm the existence of the conspiracy. Bonhoeffer was forced to systematically fabricate a tissue of lies that would mislead the Nazis as much as he could while protecting as many people as he could. This lends a sense of poignancy to his writing on what it means to tell the truth that is almost unbearable. Reading between the lines, one realizes that Bonhoeffer realized, contra Kant, that "telling the truth" might actually entail lying to the best of one's abilities. I had only one tiny complaint with the documentary. I love Klaus Maria Brandauer as an actor. He is a powerful and subtle performer, but his voice on the DVD is very hard to understand. I don't know if his accent is too thick or if the recording has too much bass to be clear. I found I could understand only a portion of what he was saying. Anyone who is moved by this documentary should certainly look further into Bonhoeffer's life and thought. I once was privileged to be part of a group of thirty or so students who had a long conversation with Eberhard Bethge about Bonhoeffer. Bethge features prominently in the film. There is no question that if you were to read only one book on Bonhoeffer, his magisterial biography is the place to go. It is massive, but it is unquestionably worth the effort. I love Bonhoeffer's ETHICS, but it might be a tad too academic for the lay reader. THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP, in which he makes his famous distinction between cheap grace and costly grace, is a wonderful book and can easily be read by someone without a strong theological background. LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM PRISON, which collects things written from the time of his arrest to the end of his life, is justly celebrated as a classic religious work. A TESTAMENT TO FREEDOM: THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS OF DIETRICH BONHOEFFER is a very fine anthology that collects writings from every period of his life. I recommend this film as strongly as possible. To me Bonhoeffer is one of the truly great Christian heroes of the past century, though his courage and sacrifice offers equal inspiration to non-Christians as well 
Since we know there is another version of "Burn" out there,i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.You can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan,poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.Brando told larry king it was his favorite film;not if he saw this package 
A few comments about why I didn't like the video for my daughter - The DVD is cheaply done. The animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving, while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he doesn't move at all. - The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas. The part where Belle almost drowns (and would have certainly died of hypothermia) is a good example of this, though not the only example. Overall the video is not at all suited for young children 
This movie does a very good job of portaying an alcoholic that has not yet found the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. The AA meetings in this movie are packed with self centered selfish and restless, irrtable and discontented people who meet to share their misery. Real AA meetings offer experience, strength and hope, and the solution to how an alcoholic can live happy lives without alcohol 
Bend It Like Beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls. The film sensitively portrays a young Indian girl's difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being. The film is enjoyable on several levels: 1) there is the cultural clash between Britons of various descent, 2) there is the hilarious "lesbian" mixup, and 3) the pure sports film. All in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people 
Ladder 49 was not the type of film I expected-- I was hoping for a good, fast-paced action flick, which I got for about the first 5 minutes. The remainder of the 30 minutes that I watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter's first days at the station. Someone looking for drama and a story about the growth of a firefighter would probably like this movie. However, those looking for action should probably look elsewhere 
Revenge, it's said, is a meal best served cold. The creepy, existential, ultra-violent OLDBOY (Tartan) takes that dish and smashes it in your face with raging. Without explanation, Oh Dae-Su, a businessman with a family, is kidnapped and imprisoned in a dank, dirty room for 15 years. Suddenly he's released, given money, a cell phone and nice clothes. On his way to revenge, he discovers his kidnapper still has plans for him, and it's something worse than what's already happened. Now he's got five days to find him and balance the books. Rated R. Genre: Asian Noir/Thriller. 2 Hours. Actors: Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang, Dae-han Ji, Dal-su Oh. Director: Chan-wook Par 
Well, I guess I should've read more reviews of this DVD. It is STRICTLY for beginners. I don't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up (if I do breath of fire it helps). When I want an easy day I'll pop this in and do both sessions. Very simple. But I'm sure it's good for a beginner--a BEGINNING BEGINNER. Sara Ivanhoe is soothing though, and encouraging. But seriously, this is a very easy workout 
Terrible voice, depressing indoor scenery, incredibly disjointed routines. Don't bother with this one! Save your money 
When buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark. Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You'd think that because they're on DVD, the quality would be better. The movies shown are low budget (B movies)with unknown actors and limited action. Need I continue ?? INACTION in this case would be best served. Save your money for better things... Like a hot fudge sundae !!! 
SYBIL is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public. The performances by Sally Field and Joanne Woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter (child abuse) and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed. Wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques, both the book and the movie became musts for students of Abnormal Psychology at that time and for decades afterwards. Joanne Woodward reverses her roles from "The Three Faces Of Eve" to portray Dr. Cornelia Wilbur with consummate skill, while Sally Field's performance as Sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another (the movie works with thirteen of the Book's sixteen personalities). Without being overtly graphic, the movie conveys all of the horrors of Sybil's childhood with an incredible impact. The rest of the cast is excellent, with Martine Bartlett's "Hattie", Sybil's mother, in the chilling forefront and Natasha Ryan as Little Sybil close behind. The real Sybil, unaware that Sally Field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with Joanne Woodward, let it be known that she wanted Stewart Stern and Daniel Petrie to try and get Sally for her part. {From the Extras Bonus Disk) I can't recommend the movie and the book enough to students of Human Behavior and Psychology, whether for personal of professional interests. It took Hollywood 30 years to try remaking the film, which should indicate how high the bar was set by this original cast and production 
I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like "The Hunt for Red October" or "Crimson Tide" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice 
This animation is as hilarious as when it was first aired, maybe even more so as the careers of some of those who sat on the good doctor's couch have blossomed eg David Cross, who you may remember from such shows as Arrested Development. Even Ray Romano is funny. The animation is great, especially the New York City scenes. Ben Katz is a scene stealer. I need to see 'Feng Shui' and 'Sticky Notes' on DVD please. 
Given the cast I had high expectations for this movie, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. The storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families. There are some nice perfomances, granted, and for this reason alone I gave it two stars. But even with that grace, it's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch. 
The old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I've compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette. The HD version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright. They also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy. The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution. 
OK,there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3D set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film. The Plot is pure ham and cheese. A whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for Dracula, Frankenstein,The Werewolf of Paris, and The Mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life.( I told you it was stupid)Before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height.If you can accept a movie on the level of a Police Academy or Earnest goes to Camp then you should not have a problem with this. Only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like Camp Blood this is a masterpiece 
Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
Love Shelly Long movies, and Bette Midler too. This is very enjoyable and funny. Was thrilled to have found a copy on Amazon. 
Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience. However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens. The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior. Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them. As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation. The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise? The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes. Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right. Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', however. I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas. Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything. This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there). It certainly couldn't be because it's funny. The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise. That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not. That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not. That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not. That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not. You get the drift. Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat. Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles. If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'. Watch a movie that doesn't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh. Sincerely, Bill Cosb 
It is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by Roger Moore' performance. Her's good for a dandy, in the continent, but in this film he is not convincing at all. He is verry debonnaire, like he is just sipping tea in Great Britain.Thus, the film becomes stiff and you don't believe it. The other actors simply try to do something, like a farce. It is a pity to see the great Richard Burton in such role. Eugenia Lizald 
This film was originally titled The Testimony of Taliesin Jones. It is named for the hero, a little Welsh boy whose mother leaves his farm family for a life in town. His experiences are touching, and seem to involve a gift of healing. Delightful, beautiful, deserves to be better known than it is 
My wife and I ejected this DVD after half way through and planned to throw it out. I later figured I'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it. The last guy is good and I won't throw this away now; he does a bit on throwing up that is good. Most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny 
I thought the film was great, it has a interesting storyline. It also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on. I don't understand why people will rate this movie so low. Is it cuz it doesn't have a pre-Hollywood established actress/actor in it? That it isn't some mainstream unoriginal film, which even the most moronic of morons can grasp? Listen don't rate this movie low if it doesn't seem good to you, because it requires thinking unlike the mainstream cookie-cutter films in the theaters. You stay to your pablum un-original mainstream films, and leave those people who work hard on indie films alone. For the people who complained the girls were dressed too little, I've seen many more hollywood films where women wear nothing but string bikinis basically. These girls were dressed for a majority of the film. For the person who said Ashley was "plump", you must really like your women to be Anorexic 
This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out and ten years later it's still just as funny. Basic plot: Ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he's ALONE on New Year's night. Anyone who's had a bad night/day on the job can relate to Ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations. From the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion, to a gangster's bratty kids, a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken Hollywood people who want to make Ted part of their hazardous (and very gross) bet. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that I will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever. If you love a good, dark comedy this is the movie for you 
An average customer review of almost 4 stars? Have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia? Jason supposedly went to hell yeah? Then why is still in one piece. This time round, the government realise there's nothing they can do to stop Jason and have him captured. He is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm. Unfortunatley, he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space! Yes space! The budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good. There may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it's just not enough! This sequel sounds more like a Star Trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good Friday the 13th flick. Supposedly, a TWELFTH Friday the 13th movie is being made (if you count the excellent Freddy Vs Jason). While Freddy Vs Jason was indeed impressive, there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore 
What a complilation! Much better than what availiable out there on him. It was good to see some of the old clips from the Sixties of Marvin. I know that there's got to be more. I especially liked the clip with Tammi Terrell. I was great to see her flirting with him while they were performing. That's the stuff of legends. I hope Motown continues this series of DVD's with their other acts. 
A friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it. Wow! Our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over. We used the DVD along with us talking about numbers and she was doing great. Before pre-school started she was able to add and subtract numbers between 0 - 10. 
The Movie: One of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90's, and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved, this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind. And despite the whining from some, usually hardline Christian, corners, it's not anti-christian at all. What it is is simply great, imaginative and clever film making, and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from Mimi Rogers, ably supported by the likes of David Duchovny, Will Patton and Patrick Bauchau. I'm not going to go into it too deeply simply because it's one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible. (Please note that I'm not attacking Christians or Christianity above, just a small, but, as usual, vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path. People who will instantly hate a film like this just "on principle" and then proclaim to all that they should avoid "such trash". You know exactly the kind of people I'm talking about. They're a minority, they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one. And none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path.) The DVD: The good news, this film is finally on dvd, and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot. The bad news, the movie has been badly misframed, which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially. I'm not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship (as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had) or whether it was just a botched transfer, but it is clearly misframed regardless as I saw this film twice on it's theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then. Plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway, and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing (so clearly they were watching the film in it's proper framing). Unfortunately this doesn't appear to be available anywhere else on dvd, so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option, just be aware going in, and hope for a better release somewhere down the track. Apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine, and the only other notable extra is the film's trailer. The bottom line: A really good, bold, interesting film on a disappointing and variable quality dvd. Mr J 
"Monk" is quite an interesting show. It is about this character named Adrian Monk (played by Tony Shalhoub, "Wings"), who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias. He is also incredibly intelligent; he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly, provided that he has all the right clues. The most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when Monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words, which, for some of the most intense cases, will really shock the audience: "I've solved the case." However, for some reason, the best part always seems to be when he says, "Here's what happened." When it comes to the scenes involving murder cases, it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very, very brutal. They will do things like whack people against the head with crowbars, slice up their bodies with chainsaws, smash their hands with car doors, and sometimes, they will even try drowning them, and like the antagonists of "MacGyver," they are not afraid to use guns, if necessary. The acting is phenomenal especially by Tony Shalhoub and Ted Levine (Capt. Stottelmeyer). The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene in each episode. Finally, this DVD is practically perfect in picture and sound quality. It has extras like featurettes and you have the option of listening to it in three different languages; English, Spanish, and French. I found it all interesting. In conclusion, this TV show has it all: good background music, great dialogue, interesting stories, good acting, and interesting cinematography. The KAB score: 8.9 super 
This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
According to IMDb, "Moulin Rouge" was shot in 1.37, not widescreen. Therefore you're not losing that much to view this in 1.33 (full screen) format 
Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
thank you wwe/vince for making another great dvd box set and also stone cold I got it this morning and popped this bad boy in and love it a must buy if your a old school wrestling fan or a new one I don't regret buying this at al 
Long, tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog, bad plot holes, and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from Bad Boys. Marcus and Mike are out about, trying to find some ecstasy they've been alerted about. They get into a bunch of fights, a bunch of car chases, they get in trouble, they argue with each other. Then they go and they get into another fight, then they get in trouble, only this time they argue with each other first. Then they argue with each other, then get into a fight, then get in trouble. Then they get into trouble, argue with each other, and get into a fight. The fights? The same thing, over and over again. Marcus is upset because he feels his life is in danger. Mike is upset because he feels Marcus is bringing in negative energy. They parody relationship therapy. There's another thing happening. It's this Cuban antagonist. We don't really care about him, really. He just kind of runs around, being Cuban and evil and all. Then we get to see him get angry at people. Then he becomes devious. Then he becomes malicious and angry again. So we watch, for over two hours, with just enough action to keep it moving. Action that involves a certain camera movement, then a reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot... The only truly interesting action scene occurred in that house with the Rastafarians, with that spinning camera thing. That was pretty clever. That's why this film got any stars at all from me. Really, all I got from this film was the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make the Bad Boys series, if there will ever be one (probably...) into the Lethal Weapon series. I also got a lot of stuff about terrible psychoanalysis which was, to me, Michael Bay telling the world that male attraction to action adventure movies is not some weird psychoanalitical crazy mess, but just good natured fun. Which is why the movie got a bit more of a higher rating from me. Otherwise, wow, was that tedious. --PolarisDi 
I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target.... craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation.... The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie. The scenery was indeed spectacular. The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered. Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful. OK, enough of the shallow stuff.... the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well. The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc. Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives. Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks? No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day. 
Whats not to like about CT? I own this DVD and the audio double cd. Thats it-believe me, thats all you'll need. What really makes it worth it is the "commentary". A fabulous and totally hillarious walk thru of all the songs on the DVD. I can think of no other band that has the ability to laugh at themselves like these guys do. That humor along with superior musicianship makes them as well as this DVD a must have! 
some idiot edited this and put two bars on the top and bottom that are part of the video so in you watch this on a laptop or widescreen tv you will also get two bars on this side. this means that when you view it, it takes up about 25-35% of the screen with four black bars taking up most of the screen. i could not even watch 5 minutes of this. complete trash. 
This documentary gives a brief introduction to Al-Jazeera, which, if you didn't know already, is the main arab language newschannel. It is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it's willingness to go where other, stated-owned and controlled arab networks won't tread. In this sense it is more than a mere arab CNN in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media. The filmmakers here interview Al-Jazeera personel, as well as some american journalists, and the american official which liases with Al-Jazeera for Centcom, the american Central Command in the present Irak war (which happens to be 30 miles from Al Jazeera headquarters). It covers the timeline from just before the war, to just after Bush anounced main millitary operations to be over. By striving to be neutral, the documentary allows you to see how Al-Jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world. They are very disappointed in the United States, but adhere strongly to its values. Also interesting is how being "on the arab side" gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values, like when they are angered by Pentagon protests at their having showed images of US prisoners, when western media routinely show Iraki POWs. An unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be. The american liaison doesn't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source, and as if that weren't enough, he is barely articulate in english and clearly doesn't know anything about the local context and history. Another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials, but doesn't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists, irritating the very people they are trying to win over. All in all it's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds. It gets four stars rather than five because of it's sometimes amateurish handling of flow, which makes it at times a bit unfocused 
I'm not one to go in length about films on Amazon, but I'll write a short little bit for this amazing film. I first saw this 10 years ago when I was in my teens and have never forgotten it, it really touched something inside of me, much like a great piece of art would affect you after seeing it up close for the first time. 
I loved Ben Vereen in the show. Wanted the music for my ipod, too. Very satisfie 
I have to say, this show did not turn me on at all. I like twisted humor and a good puppet show. This, however, didn't do much of anything. In fact, it aimed at the gutter and worked it's way down. Very disappointing. And also very low-budget. Looks like something filmed for public-access TV. I'm guessing Canadian Public-Access TV. Some people might find it funny. I understand some people find Beavis funny. I don't 
So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing. Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!! I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing. This was TERRIBLE dancing! And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music! That's IT. The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner. Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music. That's it. If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie. If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie. The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for.... Oh, and the story line? What was it again???? Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one??? The WORST movie I have seen so far... To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing. Hopefully, someday, there will be 
Added - 5 whole minutes - Documentary about how to make a great movie suck by making it a Broadway production. Deleted - Karaoke version of five songs from the soundtrack: Hold Me Now, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Rappers Delight, White Wedding Worth the extra $13 - I think not I suppose if you are one of the four people on the planet that doesn't own this classic there is a option of which edition to purchase, for the rest of us, it's just not worth it. 
This dvd takes some of the funniest episodes from the series. The Dvd is put together quite well and episodes are taped better than vhs. The only problem is with 1 or 2 episodes it splits for a quick second, but i would recommend to anyone who like any Lucille Ball items 
Based on the hyper known last farewell of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, will emerge a fabulous, extraordinary and funny script that will allow Allen to lean on Bogart `s spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend. Surrealist and inventive; tantalizing and evocative that counts with an excellent cast. Do not miss it for any reason. 
I'm another of those who saw this at Sundance, and all the things I enjoy about Gaiman and McKean's graphic novels were on display: the quiet humor, the intelligence, the delightful weirdness, the astounding visual vocabulary. Except that in this case, the words are spoken by good actors, and all those visuals get up off their feet and move. It's hard to describe the impact of watching a McKean painting move and talk. There might be those who quibble about the movie looking too "animated," but of course that's exactly the point: to create a world and make it dance. The end result, visually at least, is like nothing you've ever seen before, and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone. Some of the people I talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull, that they had seen it all before. Well, it's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve--a little "Alice in Wonderland" here, a little "Time Bandits" there, a lot of "Wizard of Oz" over here, not to mention a resemblance to Gaiman's own "Coraline." But I'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else, and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of "MirrorrMask"--after all, it's what you do with a story that determines its success. And from moment to moment, there was enough innovation and cleverness, enough delight and wonder, to make the movie a positive delight. When the movie came out in theaters I went to see it again, and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog; then a friend of mine tried to show the DVD to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the spider-thingie. (Hey, in "Wizard of Oz" the moment when the Witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me--yet it lingered in memory, and when I got older I was drawn back and fell in love with the movie. That's how this stuff works.) "MirrorMask" was probably a little too wild to be a full-out commercial success; but I bet it's going to have a long, long shelf life on DVD as people pull it out to tell their friends "Wait till you see this. 
Love the book - couldn't wait for the movie and was not disappointed! I have watched it many times, and enjoy it each time. The story was so involved and the movie just about captured every event, which is why it took two DVDs or 3 CDs (yes I have both) to show the entire story. A great way to spend a cold, winter day 
don't buy this junk,it is nothing more than trailers for 50 movies that the makers have deamed as the "worst". like another review said just look up a list somewere!! 
Leeches is a terrible movie. Dude, I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life (except the director's other film Speed Demon). When the guys were less clothes than the gals, thats not a good sign. The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director's work. They're all filled with loads of homoeroticism. Women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks. The 'roided up leeches enter their "male" victims through anal orrifices. After watching about a half hour of this mess I had to turn it off. Why does this guy fool people into renting these movies. I don't mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it's time to draw the line. No hetro relationships in this one. Just the director molesting his male stars with his camera. Horrible stuff, stay away from David DeCoteau's work and his fifty different aliases (unless you know what you're in for) 
This is a wonderful movie to keep the kids (and quite possibly yourself) entertained during an otherwise-hectic holiday. I laughed, I cried, (really, I did) and I just really enjoyed it 
This DVD was horrible. I didn't know what to expect... but after the first 10 minutes I was thinking... is this it?! What's going on? Where are they? What am I watching? After awhile I clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary... nothing. They don't even tell you where they are?! It's basically a 45 minute music video. And the music, although I like it, doesn't fit with the footage at all. I really don't understand the point of this project. I watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding. Total waste of time and money. And I am a Jack Johnson fan 
me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't 
Well, my title says it all. There is nothing special or amazing about this movie. I don't like the three main actors, and the ending was just laughable. Sorry, but it was a stupid movie 
I don't know how I managed to see this gory splatterfest TWICE in college.It's a terrible movie (next to that other awful movie "Wild Wild West" which also stars Salma Hayek) Quentin Tarantino Clooney play a pair of ne'er do wells who take a family hostage.They end up going to a strip joint filled with evil vampires...and battling them until dawn.Turns out that the strip joint is built on top of an Aztec temple,hence the bloodsucking strippers. George Clooney managed to overcome this,as well as "Batman" to get into "Syriana""Good Night,and Good Luck." He's a talented actor;too bad he couldn't save this movie through sheer charm.When it comes to heists,he's better in "Ocean'e Eleven" as a dapper casino-robbing metrosexual. Avoid this movie,unless you REALLY like gruesome,violent movies.. 
Each scene is one shot, and that shot goes on and on and on, sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action. This film is pretension personified, but that's okay. Many people can't tell the difference between pretension and art. The music too is full of squeaks and squawks. In case you didn't know, that means that the music too is high art. There is no story. Boy and girl see each other, and without preliminaries hit the sack. We see boy girl here, there, in the sack, here, there, in the sack, etc. Occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters. Because of the lack of dynamics, the film is not effective, either as drama or as eroticism. Ironically, "The Summer of '42" was much more erotic even without any nudity (which would have helped). The vaulted sex scenes are three in number, chest and shoulders, and they last about three minutes each. The much-touted fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good, more convincing than the "love" scenes. There are also a few brief full-frontal scenes of the star, who has a gorgeous body (hence, the two star rating). Bottom line: the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex. But there are many better movies for that. So, only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this. 
I feel this movie should be seen by all. It's awesome, and really makes you think. You get very attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling. I highly recommend it! Awesome movie 
Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books. However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour. 
I was happy to see a 'romantic comedy' that didn't line up with every other formula picture in the genre. Really fun stuff and some solid acting 
This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way. When the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films. Kelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious. Save your money and avoid this stinker season 
My 3 year old son loved this movie. He sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video. It was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together, they both had big smiles on their faces. The pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams. My 3 year old says "when I get big I am going to fly blue angel #5". I highly reccomend this video 
I just finished re-reading the book; it is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I've written much more but it's unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal. 
Great movie! Make it part of your collection. Good story, beautiful video and great sound. Turn your volume up on the blast-off and you will feel the power! 
i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it 
The central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920's Robin Hood and his band of gangsters. Unfortunately, even the Rat Pack cannot save this movie. The script is slow, dated,and dull. Barbara Rush's scenes are especially confusing. Her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie. Nothing comes of her apparent interest in Sinatra or Martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut. The main actors seemed to be bored, and with the exceptions of Bing Crosby and Peter Falk, walked through their performances. (Maybe they were hung over most of the time?) Save your money and borrow it from your local library. 
just like it used to be. my son has enjoy every minute of i 
OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story. The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters. The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!? Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
If they're releasing 2 volumes per season, doesn't that mean that there will be 18 sets since the show was on 9 years? At $35 a volume that's over $600.00! 
I live in South Africa where the series appeared 20 years ago.Thanks to Amazon I was able to relive the wonder of Archie Bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family,each of whom is brilliantly cast.I have series 34 and now want 12.Don't wait any longer,24 episodes of absolute delight await you 
I just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a Hollywood film (The Departed). I can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie. After watching this movie I turned to my wife and said, "This movie would have been great if it would have stared someone/anyone with an ounce of talent!" The acting is very affected and self-conscious... understand that's how Hong Kong mega-stars always act (its a sort of US 1930's throwback style). I really, really despise US film remakes - but Martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline. I would suggest watching the US version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises - not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new-found intrigue. PS I have not yet seen The Departed, but I am assuming that it is a much better version than this. HOWEVER... come on America, we have plenty of creative writers out there, can't we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots 
I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc. That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO? Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
my gosh mrs. bucket...bouquet has done it again... scared off the neighbors with tea and made us all spit our sides. please buy this if you have any decentce 
John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono were guests on the Dick Cavett show three times in 1971. Their first apearance was taped on Saturday, September 11, 1971 and was John's first interview after the Beatles had disbanded. The subsequent interviews were taped on Friday, September 24, 1971 and Thursday, May 11, 1972. Viewers, Beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among Dick Cavett and his guests. John appeared to be in his element, happily chatting with the famous talk show host. It was a good thing John rightfully defends Yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the Beatles. She has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally - after all, the individuals who made up the Beatles needed to move individually; grow; develop their own individual styles. The group could not last forever. Cavett gives John and Yoko equal time. He listens to them attentively; takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody. It is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation. Yoko is very animated during this first interview. She smokes; chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at Sarah Lawrence and shows a film she made. John and Cavett are actually funny, sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure. Be sure to get this dvd collection. It is funny; interesting; serious; thought provoking and memorable. This is something for everybody and not just Beatle fans, Yokophiles and Lennonophiles. The bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces. 
This movie has it all, especially for baby boomers of the early 1970's. Blethyn, as a betrayed widow is priceless and Nigel Ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks. The English scenery is charming and Blethyn's loyal village friends top off the movie's touching humor and happy ending. I have given this DVD as Christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too. A MUST OWN 
Unfortunatly this DVD set is defective. On disc 1 episode 3 the picture just freezes and then loops back to the opening scene. I sent one back to Amazon then got a replacement and had to send that one back as well. So I thought maybe the ones at the store might not be defective so I bought a copy at Target and it's the same problem! I've written to Anchor Bay twice and they haven't bothered to reply. This situation really angers me because I love this season but am not going to waste money on a defective product. Don't buy this DVD until the problem is resolved!!!! 
I did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised! The dvd was a must own as soon as it came out 
'The Bunker' is one of three films that deal with Hitler's final days as the Soviets encircle Berlin and put an end to the Third Reich in April/May 1945. 'The Bunker' is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three (the others being 1973's 'Hitler: the last ten days' and 2005's 'Downfall') at the same time. The triumph of 'The Bunker' is Anthony Hopkins tour de force performance as Hitler, at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel. The element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a 1/3 of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted Nazi war criminal Albert Speer. One thing that makes 'The Bunker' different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks, and although brief they do allow Hopkins to portray Hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode, casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat. In the bunker itself Hopkins turns Hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy "the scourge and pestilence of Jewish Marxism!" 'Hitler: the last ten days' does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in 'The Bunker' and that is Michael Lonsdale as Martin Borman, Hitler's personal secretary and gatekeeper, a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals. Despite its flaws 'The Bunker' earns a high rating as the Hopkins performance simply cannot be missed. 
I watched about fifeteen minutes before I got enough. It was so un-Biblical it was insulting. Besides that, it's a bore 
Peter Palmer and Leslie Parrish are excellent in this fun, politically skewering musical comedy. The songs are upbeat fun, especially "Put Em Back" sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates 
This is the classic WW2 submarine war movie, and most WW2 submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie. I greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action, based on what I read about WW2 submarines. The special effects are a bit cheesy, you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships...but if you overlook those items, you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty of action 
I did this workout for the very first time today and I don't think I've felt ever felt this good about myself. This DVD works. It's not high impact aerobics, but I don't think I've ever sweat that much in one workout before. And I totally disagree with whoever said the breaks every twenty minutes makes you sleepy. I'm not in very good shape, so I need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout (I didn't think I'd like this DVD because it is one of the longer ones Ana and Ravi put out). I am really, really looking forward to getting the other two Fat Free DVDs to add to my collection 
This DVD kick starts the longest running animated prime-time show ever. The first season was an experiement to the show.

Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire: Homer becomes a Santa at the mall to earn money for christmas. Rating 8.7/10 Bart the Genius: Bart cheats on his amplitude test at school and is sent to a genius school. Rating: 8.9/10 Homer's Odyessy: Homer is fired from the power plant and becomes a crusader for citizen safety in Springfeld. Rating: 8.6/10 There's No Disgrace Like Home: Homer tries to get his family more civilized. Rating: 8.8/10 Bart the General: Bart tries to get back on Nelson Muntz, the school bulley.

Rating: 8.6/1 
i saw this on tv the other night and had to switch channels halfway. worst film ever, i dont care if this did'nt help you, this film p!ssed me off so much that i had to write a hateful review. how is it meant to be entertainin 
"The Good Earth" must be considered a "milestone movie." As yet, there is no DVD but one packed with out-takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome. There was no Oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939; otherwise, "The Good Earth" would have 'taken home' that award! The lovely Luise Ranier did win "Best Actress" award. The 1937 movie was based on Pearl Buck's novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Interest in "The Good Earth" was revived in Fall 2004 when it was selected for "Oprah's Book Club". Perhaps women's rights advocates should also give it a boost? The story is about China in the 1900s. A simple farmer, Wang Lung, is 'given' (by his father) the slave O-Lan, for his bride. I do not remember much from childhood about this film, but I definitely do not recall Paul Muni having such a mouthful of teeth! (special effecrs?!) Luise Ranier had won an Oscar the previous year for her role in the "Ziegfield Follies" -- what a contrast! Here she is the completely docile, loyal wife; as someone wrote, she was bound to her husband in "eternal servitude." And her devotion was betrayed. Partly through the machinations of "Uncle". At every time of crisis in the story along comes (GROAN!) the crafty, manipulatve uncle (Walter Connolly) who whines wheedles - - inserting humor (?) into the script and at the same time destroying family amity. From the Internet Movie Database are the prophetic words of former slave O-Lan: "When I go back in that house, it will be with my son in my arms. I'll have a red coat on him... and red flower trousers... and a hat with a gilded Buddha and tiger-faced shoes, and I'll go into the kitchen where I spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe, and I'll show myself and my son to all of them." (Smiles, contented) Wang Lung: "Well... Now, I... I haven't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house." Isn't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago? I found the quality of framed camera shots surprising the production of many scenes quite amazing. READ Susan Wong's wonderfully perceptive review on amazon.com. Today's movie-goers don't seem to care about "true life" documentation in films, but animation couldn't convince as the 1930s true-life locusts do! That tired word "awesome" truly fits this vintage film: the choking drought famine, the beautiful 'condensed' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm, and the terrifying scenes of revolutionary uprisings. REVIEWER mcHAIKU HAILS THIS FILM, and others that made an impact on my childhood! 
When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street 
Trapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept. They did it in Saw II, House on Haunted Hill, And Then There Were None, and I'm sure quite a few others. But that plot seems to always work. It does for me. House of 9 is no exception. It doesn't follow a storyline that's predictable, even though the plot is not unknown. There are surprises, suspense, thrills and tense moments. Believe me, you won't predict the ending. I was very satisfied with the movement of this film. It's an interesting watch 
I'll cut to the meta-chase since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews... The basic message of this film seems to be that state controlled "education" is worthy of resurrection and total dictatorship is the way to achieve it. Though the latter point is probably true, the former is questionable indeed. Why try and save an obviously moribund and mindless system of government indoctrination from its own demise? Don't blame the kids, you have only to look at the state of the world to see the utter failure that so-called educated people have already created everywhere, with world fascism now its ultimate fruitage, and the kids at some level know it...Clearly we urgently need a new vision of education altogether, but this film only asks us to glorify what has already died... 
The seconf GIG is trying to be good. I only watch the show just to see the action the story is boring. I love the being opening scene with the music playing even the animation is a little better then the first season. And its a bit more mature then the first season 
We saw the movie in the theatre and loved it. The DVD we just purchased was horrible. They chopped out so much of the movie it made it un-watchable. It is only good for a coaster under my drink now 
This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to "Angel heart"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo "Delta" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term "special edition" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series). Don't buy it. Maybe there's a better version (I read talk of a "Critereon" disc), maybe not. Still, it really isn't worth (any) money 
Love this dvd. I loved the live performance at the MTV awards. She has my vote 
I really loved this story! Each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding 
This movie is a rehash of the first, but it is a crappy, unconvincing, emotionally uninspiring movie. Let me guess what part 3 will be about: A guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time, does not alter that timeline the way he wants (i.e. always worst case scenario) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else 
This is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor I really enjoyed watching it. I think it has great replay value as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness. I found it more reminiscent of the old 60's films like 'Monte Carlo or Bust' or 'Those Magnificent men....'. Jackie Chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action-packed foil to 'Fillius Fogg' played with brilliant English reserve self-deprecating humor by 'Steve Coogan'. There's no comparison to the original the film doesn't even try to copy. Rather, it takes a silly story with silly character's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action/adventure/comedy movies you'll see. Because this isn't a typical 'Martial Arts' vehicle for 'Jackie Chan' I found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline. Check out for instance the fight-scene in the Art-Gallery which goes to show why 'Jackie Chan' is probably the best Action/Comedy star in the world right now. There's much that's Chaplain/Keaton-like in his performance all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts. The guest-stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices, most notably 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' (What I think is the best Comedy ever this is by no means a comparison). Anyway 'Arnold Swarzenneger' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a Turkish Prince no less (Possibly the poorest Arabian impression ever, which is of course why it works so well) and 'Rob Schneider' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice. Miss 'Cecile de France' is a beautiful Comedy foil manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent I hope to see more from her. You might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but I found a lot of it to be nicely restrained, this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set, check out the extras. All in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy/Action/Adventure with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing. 
This 1954 musical release is just too good/too fun to pass up. Adam (Howard Keel - oh my god, what a voice) needs a wife and zeros in on Milly (Jane Powell) to drag back to his Oregon Territory farm and six unruly brothers. The tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge. Milly makes believers out of them. The brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town. Whoops, they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets snowed-in for winter. The songs are lovely, the story charming, but it's the dance choreography that brings me back again and again. There are two numbers in particular which showcase the brothers' dance skills, and they are outstanding. Julie Newmar of Catwoman fame is one of the kidnapped cuties. They stick her in the back or whisk her out completely for the more involved dance routines, but who cares, it's Julie Newmar 
Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites. Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited. Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups. This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging. By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath. I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
I bought this set a couple of weeks ago and just finished getting through it. It is well worth the money. You won't be sorry you bought it. Funny as it gets 
In all of the other X-men DVDs, they show very little on the couple that i like the best. Kitty and Lance. the first episode Joyride, is when Lance joins the X-men. Not everyone is pleased, but almost all are. Scott is the one who hates Lance and Doesen't believe that Lance is doing this out of truth. well when cars, jets, start mysterisoly getting very dirtty. Scott blames it all on Lance. But is it Lance or is someone else having the Joyride?? and Walk on the Wild Side is a episode very good towards "Girl Power" Jean, Boom Boom, Rouge, Magma,Kitty decide to become the BayVille Sirens. Stoping crime and Wearing Leather in the process. the other Two epsiodes are worth getting the Disc After All, any X-Men DVD is worth it 
This DVD set was outstanding. The 5th and 6th seasons of Seinfeld were at the height of the show. Great extras! 
these movies are beautiful and intense, one of those you must watch and enjo 
You know, Shrek 2 is the embarassment of American culture. What's wrong with it you ask? Let's see... too much slapstick humor, too many movie references, or parodies, and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying CLASSIC DISNEY CHARACTERS!!! That's just unbelievable, Dreamworks! Disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry, and you just make fun of them. That's a real shame. You should be thanking Disney for all what animation offers nowadays. Disney classics have heart, humor, and a beautiful story. Shrek 2 lacks that. Shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility, never to be seen again!! 
I was hoping that "Socermania" would be on the "Extreme Sports Fun" DVD but NO! Instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the "Disney Treasures" this also goes for the other two DVD's Extreme Music and adventure fun, allthough 'Pluto's Blue Note', 'Donald's Dilemma' 'No Sail' 'Old Sequoia' and 'Trailer Horn' are on DVD for the first time but with the new Disney Treasures "Disney Rarities" and "The Chronological Donald volume 2"(which might I add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration) who needs these DVDs, so I suggest not to buy these cheap DVD's and buy the Treasures in spite of the bad restoration 
I grew up watching this movie... its a movie I seem to never get bored with. Paul newman is an awesome actor, and if you are a fan of his, this is a must have in your movie collection!!!! 
Not a good copy of this great movie. I'd wait and buy the Restored Authorized Edition. Even though I bought this version, I've ordered the other. That's how much I like Metropolis is general 
This movie looks simply amazing! The color, texture and detail provided by HD-DVD are superb, this is a showcase title for the format. First a word about my setup, which is nice but far from optimal. The HD-DVD player is connected via HDMI to a Sanyo PL-Z4 projector, with an approximately 140" picture thrown onto a light beige wall. The room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades. Hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado's but my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it. Now about the title - there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere. None. I also bought this title on SD-DVD and have watched on an upscaling DVD player, both on a 57" crt bigscreen and the projector, and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases. They're most noticeable on large surface solid colors, of which there are many in this movie. You'll see them "dance" and shimmer on SD-DVD, not so on HD-DVD. The colors are bold and bright when appropriate, but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the snow-covered streets of the town with the factory looming in the background. You can make out more detail, without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original SD-DVD version. The lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version, not a ringed mess. The story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original, rather its told from a slightly different perspective, giving more insight into Willie Wonka's character, and updating the other kids (Violet, Mike Teavee, etc...) to reflect a newer generation of youngsters. Mike feels a bit weak, he's portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces his character, then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie. Veruca and Violet by contrast are more prominently featured, and you'll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie. Augustus also suffers a bit but since he's the first to get ousted from the party, it's logical that he won't be as fully developed as a character. His romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however. Overall I'd give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for HD-DVD owners, but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits, even in SD-DVD presentation 
I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character. Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie. This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
you gotta get the whole series....you can't just get one or two dvds...you need the whole thing, trust me. Once you start you gotta go all the way to the end 
With present day footage masterfully juxtiposed with much,heretofore unseen,period film, this multi-disc history of the Great War breathes life into the first quarter of the twentieth century unlike an i've seen thus far. We are shown how the echoes of events that occured nearly a century ago still resonate with deafening clarity in our twenty-first century lives. The mistakes which plunged the world into a decades long bloodbath are laid out in a way that describes, in riveting detail, the follies and grave consequenses of cavalier militarism. This series is neither dry or pedantic but illumunates facts with which everyone should be acquainted. Perhaps we can avoid a repetition of this debacle 
The Movie with the 20,000-mile or one-million-laugh guarantee ! Crank your Engines ! With a roar , sputter and pop , drivers wheel westward in wacky turn-of-the century autos for a New York-to-Paris race . Ahead 20.000 miles , a barroom brawl , a sinking iceberg 2.357 pies in the face and incalculable laughts . Blake Edwards (1922- ) turns a marvelous cast loose on a round-the-world higway booby-trapped by some of the funniest screen gags ever . Jack Lemmon (1925-2001) and Peter Falk (1927- ) are nasty Professor Fate and his dim henchman Max . Tony Curtis (1925- ) is their good-guy nemsis , the Great Leslie and Nathalie Wood (1938-1981) is cheroot-puffing suffragatte reporter Maggie DuBois . Zestily scored by Henry Mancini (1924-1994) and ravishing in a New digital transfer with revitalized digital audio from restored elements , The Great Race is great fun ! . As i mention Super transfer and Recommended highly ! 
The sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering. I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie. But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD 
When I was looking for a fitness DVD for me and my two oldest children (girls, ages 3 1/2 and 2) to do together, I was impressed with the reviews of this DVD and it sounded intriguing. Though I wasn't really willing to shell out 16 bucks quite yet, so we rented it from Netflixs to try it out first. As adults my husband and I were really turned off by the "animated" bear, though our girls liked him. Another thing that I wasn't really impressed with was the camera was at times only focusing on Kristi Dear's face or the animated bear and it was hard for me and our girls to follow exactly what moves she was doing when. We had to run through the DVD a second time to really get the routine. The total time of the DVD is 30 minutes, but only about 20-22 minutes of that is actual warm-up or workout time. The rest is filler about why we need to exercise and eat healthy foods and snacks, which is fine to watch for the first time or two, but then I found myself fast forwarding through it to get to the workout sections. Which if I had to do that every single time I watched it with my girls, I would get annoyed really fast. My husband really did not think it was worth 16 dollars, he'd be willing to spend maybe 5-7 dollars on it, but no more. I gave the DVD 2 stars because Kristi Dear really does a good job of communicating with kids, has a pleasant voice, and demonstrates easy moves and routines for kids to do. I highly recommend that you rent this first to see what you really think about it. 
I'll admit that I'm a Johnny-come-lately to the "Madea" series, finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece. Creator Tyler Perry and his alter-ego, the opinionated, pistol-packing, chain-smoking (never lit, by the way) "Madea," have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans, mostly African-American, nationwide. Though the stories feature the tried-and-true clich�d characters (the belligerent teenager, the devoted wife, the straying husband, the vixens, the lotharios, etc.) and situations (infidelity, promiscuity, straying from the church, comedic funerals, obnoxious and overbearing family members), Perry's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story's ending dependent upon DIVINE INTERVENTION making things right. Some of the acting performances are a little over the top, and the musical selections, though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists, are weak in the lyrics department; however, as a whole, the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational. Perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by Hollywood, and is having great success on both the stage and screen. This compilation lets the viewer experience and/or revisit those money-making stage shows. 
Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it 
Other reviews rant about Ms. Judd; frankly, after Double Jeopardy and High Crimes, I'm not seeing the superb actress, but that's aside the point. This movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else-- Search for truth, not innocence. Especially if you are an attorney 
After Spinal Tap, this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown. But like ST, it is right on. These wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it's satire, it's real. If you hate even the idea of folk music, skip it--or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people. If you were there--I was--it's a real hoot(enanny)! Sadly, here in California, they were to be found en masse at every local 99 Cents Only stores. I realize this is not for everyone, but neither was Spinal Tap. Give it a try 
24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way. My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste. Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
This film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters. However, its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful, the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences, and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul. Although I have recommended this film to several people, I caution them that it can be pretty disturbing. I thought about it for weeks after I saw it the first time, and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again. Definitely not a "light hearted" evening of entertainment 
I didn't find this DVD too bad to watch, but I wouldn't watch it again. It had tons of good artists but I dont wanna have to sit down and watch a whole bunch of interviews. I think this DVD needed a lot more action of rappers on the streets or somethin, just my opinion 
I FIRST WATCHED THIS INCREDIBLE GROUP OF MUSICIANS I BELIEVE ON AUSTIN CITY LIMITS AND WAS TOTALLY TAKEN IN BY THE MAGIC THESE GUYS PERFORM ALONG WITH VERY, VERY GOOD CAMERA WORK WHICH COMPLIMENTED THEIR EVERY MOVE. PAT'S FASCIALS ARE CAPTURED INTENSLY AS WELL AS ALL OF THE MUSICIANS PERFECTIONISM.. THE PERFORMANCE IS FLAWLESS AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF FEELING AS IF "YOU ARE HERE". BRAVO!!

Well what can I say about this movie? Well one thing is: It wasn't what I'd expected. Those who'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but I still wanted to see it. I was wrong and they were right. The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care. Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story. The entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It's pointless to watch. The most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper', which wasn't the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear. For those of you planning to buy this DVD, stay away. It's a huge rip off. It's just something to keep you waiting for Shrek 3 
HELLO????? Whoever mastered this great film RUINED it by FORGETTING or REFUSING to provide English subtitles for the Japanese and Italian characters. How can such a thing happen? If you find the VHS buy it. Maybe some day someone will make the corrections. Until then, AVOID this DVD 
Astonishing. You have to see it to believe. Just turn off the lights, seat back and have fun. And Amazon delivery is realy great 
What do I think of when someone says "Disney!"? Hmmm...kiddy films, girly stuff, princess(groan, we don't need more of that!), dreams come true and...cheesy? Yep, all of the things above are in Ice Princess, with some fresh twists. With the "mean rival" changed to "nice rival", and add "with hard work" after "dreams come true". I mean, look at Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what did they do to make their dreams come true, which is a pathetic one, to marry a prince? One had a 100-year beauty sleep and the other had a fairy-godmother to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand! Casey Carlyle was totally different. I agree with people, that it's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I give this film a 4 and not a 5. But it's an improvement. The cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done, and while people on IMDB say that they're to showy, it is true, but aww, come on, this is a movie, not a real competition, and everybody likes some nice ice-skating in movies. The acting is great, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Hayden Panettiere. Michelle's acting is really good, and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements. Hayden Panettiere's acting is also good, but it's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and "Mary-Sue"ish. "Mary-Sue"ish would mean that she's almost perfect. She's smart, good at sports and extremely popular also. It is very unfair, because on the page I'm writing this review on, it says "Ice Princess (Widescreen Edition)~JOAN CUSACK. I know she and Kim Catrall or the ones with fame, and don't mistake me, the acting IS good, but Casey and Gen completely steals the stage, and in the place of Joan Cusack, it should be the names of those two. The soundtrack is wonderful, especially Reachin' for Heaven and No One. Delicious songs! And Reachin' for Heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the 78th Oscar Nominations List. Good luck 
This film is the best film that Disney has in it's live-action collection! Every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life. I really like all the extras on the disc as well I like seeing how the film was created, looking at deleted scenes, learning about the history of real pirates, and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of Walt Disney himself 
I am a big fan of Kurt Russell but this movie sucks. And as Forrest Gump said, "thats all I have to say about that. 
This is a sad little gem of a movie. I really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love. The story had as much to do with issues of identity, community, and fidelity. In my opinion, there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved, especially when considering the quality of the performances. The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. Considering the type of story and the setting, I can't help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film. I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character 
Every store should have a DVD shredder for movies that suck. Rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away. Adding Darryl Hannah and Denise Richards to an already horrible story line just to sell DVDs is a disgrace. Trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one. Save your time, money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video. 
This dvd is awesome. It covers Michaels disco years through the 1990s. "Beat it" and "Billie Jean" are timeless videos and show you Michael Jackson at his creative zenith. This dvd also includes the full length videos of "Bad" and "Thriller" Lets not forget "Remember the time" with its amazing dance moves and catchy rythem. This dvd compilation makes you see why Michael Jackson will always be the king of pop. I like this dvd out of all of Michael Jacksons dvd releases. "Dont stop till you get enough" and "Rock with you" may be simple videos but I watch both videos and see an innocence in Michael before the Thriller phenomenon. This is the best of Michael Jackson. Sony dvd has done an incredible job on the sound quality of this Michael Jackson dvd. The sound quality on a regular television or theatre system will amaze you 
OK, this movied is a favorite. Having said that, I am less than blown away by this new transfer. Still looks a bit dull to me. It's a fun set though. Getting the box was a no-brainer. Am I the only one who's missing the poster offer? A sticker on the outside claims that the offer is to be found within. Well I don't see it.. 
This is a GREAT movie! I would encourage EVERYONE to see this one... even if you have never even known someone with this condition, you should buy this movie. There are not enough movies like this one out there. We need to support this type of film making. I don't want to give the plot of the movie away, so I won't go into great detail. Watching this movie gives me hope. Hope for so many people out there with this illness. Hope that they or someone close to them will watch this and will give this diet a try. Don't give up hope. Thank you to whomever made this film possible. 
I was so bored by this film that I thought I might be missing some subtle French cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting. I asked a younger, French, female friend, who said she found it at least as boring as I did. The characters didn't engage my sympathy. Nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other, so I didn't care what happened to them. Scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity didn't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves. The sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable. I sat through to the end, thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes. I want my money back. Plus damages 
If you are not familiar with research, this nice approach to a scientist's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies. Besides, this very interesting and moving film, with high level and homogeneous performances, will show, the closest it can, the early facts about such a terrible disease. I strongly recommend it. I have seen it with my 16 year old son, but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age. A bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience. 
This was my first exercise ball tape I bought. Being a larger size person, I found that this was a help to getting started. I can do most of the exercises right away. I like that it has exercises with weights also. I find this a help to getting back into shape, even with my bad back. 
Bette Midler and Woody Allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing. Instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as Bette and Woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school. They also discover that they have been cheating on one another. The movie gets boring rather fast as Bette and Woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters. I would have expected better from these two 
Ernest Borgnine would be spinning in his grave if he were dead. There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie! The actors should be embarrassed! I could only stomach 25 minutes of viewing and it was about as funny as a viewing in a mortuary. I can't believe I paid $9.99 for this DVD. What a fool I was. Learn from my mistake 
It's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch Samurai Jack before bed. Back when she was 3, and it was played on Cartoon Network, they made sure to watch it together. Now that Cartoon Network is retarded and they don't play it anymore, I've bought Seasons 1 and 2. I just wish it was played on Cartoon Network like it used to be. ...Jill Henrichse 
So-so movie. It has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch. When a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew, he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of............. many ghosts. Just a OK movie. 
after the worst "friday" movie of all time(and thats saying a lot) the series bounces back (nine years later) with this fun and nice change of pace for the series is just what the doctor ordered.having been caught and chained by the goverment, jason escapes killls everyone but one fine looking doctor who "buck rogers" like freezes jason and her self in the underground lab they are at. flash foward to 2455 and earth,now unliveable, is visited by a group of students who free jason and the doctor from the lab. before you can say "CEH CEH CEH"( the best way i can spell the theme song) jason is loose on the starship and cutting apart the crew. like i said the novel setting and the use of some great f/x make this one of the best of the series 
"Mighty Quinn" features a young sexy Denzel Washington (Xavier Quinn) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island. There's a shadowy plot involving $10,000 bills, a guerilla movement and guns, but the movie focuses more on Quinn's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder, and Quinn's own discomfort from having "made good" but ending up caught between two worlds, white and black. He's also caught between the islanders' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation. This film is full of sexy island women, colorful reggae music, and real world dilemmas of race and identity. No matter that we couldn't quite figure out if the plot hung together. A winner 
It's really refreshing to watch series such as Bones. It's witty and suspenseful. Unlike Law and Order, this show has more...well everything. The characters are all very likeable. There are little romantic moments between the main characters that make the show more interesting. basically...just get season 1, you won't regret it 
This man is like Michael Bay. Using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing, the fact that Chris Tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it's patheic and not funny, and that is also why the man who is now making X-Men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies. The man is a joke 
If there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides "Saving Private Ryan," this is it. The story starts with a lawyer visiting England as a tourist years after war's end. He discovers a cheap, ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value. "Value?" replies the lawyer. "Wrap it very carefully" he adds. So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th (nine, eighteenth) Bomb Group. This "hard luck" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has "over-identified" with his men, thus putting them before his missions. The general, Frank Savage, must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit. General Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit. They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind, or letting down their new leader. (Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel piece in the Officers' Club, and turning the head of a ceramic pirate, face outward.) But the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes. He will always keep the mission first, and will not over-identify with his men. He will not let the loss of his men affect him. Or, will he? This black white story is exceptional and superbly acted. It shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect. It depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves, and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime. This is not a gory story, but it is one that will leave you breathless. It may sadden you, but it will not disappoint you. It does not end with everyone living, or happy. War never does. P.S. The "whole nine yards" refers to the length of ammunition linked together that fed into the machine guns aboard each bomber 
I really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work. I'm a photographer but not this line of work. It was an interesting glimpse into their lives. I wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries, personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting. Some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it. 
If you like action, shooting, explosions, fire, pain, torture and revenge, this is a movie you'll love. And, it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role. A great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality. 
When I sat down to watch a movie called Three Woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is Shelley Duvall, my first reaction was that I would be better off drinking a nice, tall glass of toilet water. But, that reaction was short lived. It is rare for me to enjoy a movie that I was determined to hate from the first second, but this movie forced me to pull a 180. The ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go. It is a trance like movie. I found that I couldn't stop from watching yet, I didnt know why I was watching. Very bizzare, and very mezmerizing. Not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however. 
I went and saw another film as I was so disenchanted with this one. The opening had so little to do with the rest of the film I thought I was watching a preview to another film. I don't care for spoofs about Catholics and protestants. The Pythons can't sing or dance (for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable). I say to the fans of Python: get a life 
Okay, this is a really bad movie. That said, there are some moments here that are so over-the-top bad that they're funny. The fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving Sandra Bullock is outright hilarious...and very embarassing. How she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery, but the acting in that scene is ridiculous, as well. However, it is certainly memorable. Sandra Bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film, but her role is essentially a throw away part. Then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor Steve Buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in. His character never returns to the story after that. By the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues. The acting is bad, the budget is obviously low, and the script, which invokes the occasional giggle, is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel. Avoid this film 
I have a few friends who "don't like cartoons". I guess they were brought up on Hannah-Barbara drek and it turned them off of the whole genre. When I run into this attitude,I pull out Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoroto show them the beauty, subtly, and power of animation. 
The saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series. I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv'd it, the same can't be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D' Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}. As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little. There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable. 
Often overlooked, Robert Altman's 'The Long Goodbye' is arguably one of THE films exemplifying the 1970s and, although far less dark, ranks alongside Antonioni's 'The Passenger'. Propelling Marlowe into the opulent, 'promise' of the west coast 1970s USA, Altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder, mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial 'goings-on' that can subsequently be seen in the works of David Lynch, Tarrantino and, more recently, the 'Sopranos'. The late, great Sterling Hayden gives an unforgetable, bullying, volatile King Lear-like performance as the ageing, impotent, alcoholic writer, and Mark Rydell's 'dangerous' violent character anticipates that which Martin Scorsese and Joe Pesci create latterly in Goodfellas/Casino. Moreover, there's an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed Arnold (Schwarzenneger) as a 'heavy'. However its Elliiot's Gould's brilliant (Oscar deserving) performance as Philip Marlowe that helps to seal this film's status into the canon of GREAT films. Gould creates a sharp, amiable, chain-smoking, wise-cracking 70s detective whose 'quirky-alone' livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own Chandleresque, talking-to-himself dialogue (...'it's alright by me...') whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative. With respect to this, there's the continual variation of the haunting melody, 'The Long Goodbye' that is re-worked throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself. Altman's direction is that of a genius at work: the back-drop of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative Eilleen Wade's windows (Nina Van Pallandt), together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment setting of Marlowe's flat make this film unforgetable. There's also the tension associated with the 'journeys' to Mexico: a theme used in more recent (great) films including 'Lone Star'; 'Traffic'; and, 'The Three burials of Melquiades Estrada'. Who can deny the impact of the opening 'cat' scene and the final 'chapter' of the film set within the avenue of trees; the 'oh-too-late' figure of Eileen Wade heading in the opposite direction to Marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica. If ever a film rated as a '6' for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award! I urge you to watch or re-watch this film and savour a work of pure genius. As a commentator and fan of such a seminal film, I can only hope that Robert Altman and-or Elliot Gould can provide a commentary-enhanced (Criterion edition )DVD 
This movie is a great movie to add to your DVD collection. Especially if you are a mob fan. This movie is about corruption within the mob, about betrayal, about death and dying. It starts off with someone trying to whack the don, and the family trying to find out who it is and why. I'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story. Just watch it. Mario Puzo's The Last Don (1997) was great too 
We just got this DVD last week, but ever since that time it has remained in the DVD player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter, Cassidy. She LOVES this DVD and all the planets that come to life. She sings along and has really learned her planets. The songs are top notch. The DVD is enjoyable for adults, even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful. A+++++++++++ 
I love when a blonde, assumed air-head, realizes her dreams. She even goes far beyond what she thought she wanted. She is lovely, funny, smart, honest, and hard-working. Who wouldn't love her? So glad this movie was made 
I haven't watched the first season - I just started watching the show so I'm a very brand new viewer - but I've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show. Its subject matter is grim, yes, but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry, especially David Boreanaz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel) and Emily Deschanel. The stories are interesting w/out being too scientific so anyone can follow along. And I never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone's bones (okay, maybe only in tv land). 
I have loved this movie since I first it back in the early 1990's. In all honesty it is pretty crudy but that's what I love about it. The music is fantastic and the costumes are unique. Divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and Ricki Lake was perfect for the role. Link is pretty hunky too..... 
Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring. 
Standard Elmo - Nothing special, but still a good video 
I have nothing negative to say at all just want to leave a little info on Battlestar Galactica Season 1. If you are about to buy BSG season 1 and the mini series don't bother picking up the mini series battlestar season 1 comes with the mini series. i didnt know and I spent an extra $17.00 for nothin. Well someone I know is gunna get that for X-mas so not a complete loss but still kinda annoying if you know what i mean. Happy Holidays 2 U all!!! 
Get ready for this workout. The beginner DVD's are butt kickers for a 1/2 hour workout. The advanced DVD's are killer. I definitely got my money's worth with this set. There's no excuse not to be in better shape if you have this product. 
Li is no heavy-weight pianist. Neither is Bunin or even Zimerman. And don't foeget that Chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all. And judging from the steam and progess Li has made, Lang Lang's position is certainly under threat. And any viewer who is interested in Li or how Chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this-- here we have to thank Martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the Chopin Competition. Now in his mid-twenties, and musically out of almost nowhere, Li is already a full fledged musician. Of course, viewers should not compare him with Arrau's fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register; or his scales with Richter's. This is not fair, for Arrau and Richter are such great artists. Li is already so close to Zimerman now. Furthermore, what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall, something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself. And I say so because I'm a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this DVD. It appears to me more like a VCD than DVD production (or somewhere in between): it is slightly below average DG production and the camerawork is also average only. This is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that Li is now having. One star is taken for want of a better production. 
I returned this as I found out it was either letterbox or wide screen format, I only buy or want tapes or dvds that fill the entire tv screen, otherwise I dont buy the 
Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
Naysayers have proclaimed this neglected gem as depressing and self-indulgent, but perhaps they are just scared of seeing a movie starlet get truly "real" and show us the ugly truths about celebrity. Asia's film would make a good double bill with DOGVILLE to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism. Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude. She should be recognized as a hero, instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a self-pitying exhibitionist. But I bet if a man made this film, these selfsame critics would line up to praise it. Obviously many self-proclaimed feminists (of both sexes) are still secretly terrified, turned-off and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her "real" self. They are all the more angry because their knee-jerk reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly "liberated" female voice as they might like to think. I say Asia has created something truly new with Scarlet Diva. It's ahead of its time and will one day be recognized as the forerunner of a brave new kind of "chick flick. 
I felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer. After about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so I turned it off. 
Hal Hartley never fails to entertain, never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level. Simple Men is no exception. The seemingly simple plot - two brothers in search of their missing dad - provides so much room for character growth that I wish there were an entire series of films centered around them. With a hard-edged view of the world as: "There's no such thing as adventure. There's no such thing as romance. There's only trouble and desire" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920's) there's plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley's ambivalent theories. Simple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena Lwensohn. In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50's beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth's "Kool thing." Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number. Many dismiss this film, and Hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point. What is amazing about Hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that, once seen, reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane. Simple Men is pure cinematic delight. Hooray for Hartley 
This movie was obviously weak in many ways, one of them being the acto 
I, too, found this DVD a bit boring. The instruction for each pose took forever, even in the challenging workouts. While in-depth explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices, I didn't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence. Also, I did not feel as if there was any flow to this DVD. 
Federico Fellini's 1972 film is not his best, when he has 8 1/2, La Strada and La Dolce Vita to his credit. While many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless, dreamy structure, I found it boring and phantasmagorical. It is simply Fellini's version of Rome and not Rome, the Eternal City itself. To risk sounding negative, I shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970's Rome - the scenes in which the hippies and American tourists invade the city, the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off (though saying some pretty vulgar things) and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old Roman Patricians fade into oblivion. But mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot. It starts off alright, and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences. Fellini is himself in this movie, as well as Gore Vidal. Fellini envisions himself as a young man studying Rome in his youth in a strict Catholic school (the slide/projector shows ancient monuments like the Colliseum, the Apian Way, Trevi Fountain and Vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman's behind) and later as a young man journeys to Rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum. Then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless, vulgar and long-winded. I found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage! It bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution, brothels or cheap, slutty women. The cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film. And for a film about Rome and Italy, there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater. The Pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous. Only serious, hardcore fans of Fellini will want to own this DVD. It is a perfect follow-up to his equally absurd and sexually radical Satyricon, loosely based on the old Roman epic. 
This movie is worth owning. It's a classic tale, well done and very entertaining 
I have been a fan of CSI since the first season has come out. I am an avid collector of DVDs and I'm way behind, I'm on another show right now as we speak. Anyway, I love the sound, and the special features are always low, but I don't mind that. There is just one thing that I did not like. Part of the cover case on my season four dvd, came off. It still fits into my DVD collection, and I obviously won't buy another copy because the DVD's are working fine, but the plastic may come into a problem 
Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie. Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and "sparks fly." As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe. From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless: Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians? Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production? What mayhem ensues? In point of fact, however, the single attempt at "comedy" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats. The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the "actresses" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers. Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore. The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic. There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders. About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street. Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters. Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves. If so, then this IS bad acting. If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances. Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film. 
This anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network, and now is definetly considered a classic alongside Cowboy Bebop and others. This is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people. Yoko Kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect. It's so beautiful and fits the story so well. The overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful. As for the languages and region, while I wouldn't know yet for this particular box set, I would assume it is just like the individual DVDs they put out with Japanese and English language and English subtitles. And I don't know where to look for the region of the DVD, but I think it might be region 1, whatever it means. I do know that I haven't had any troubles playing it on any of our DVD players. [...] 
The series was always delightful because it was fun, done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek. Pierce Brosnan was great and Stephanie Zimbalist was a wonderful partner. Loved 'em both. Nice to be able to see it again because I enjoyed it so much and because there is nothing on TV like it today. 
What looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment. Whilst you expect some plot to come together (at least on first viewing) - it is strung together to confuse - even to frustrate the viewer. I was given no warning about the really really bad quality. Having a HD Large display does not help either. The sound is annonying as is irritating. In fact I got a refund on the movie hire! I don't expect overboard special effect and CGI overlays. I expected the quality to be above a cheap CAM recorder however. The plot is complicated and the noise in the background adds to the disorientation which is done on purpose. On the other note: The cheap and nasty props do not add anything to crediblility either. Stay clear - but if you have the time and want to view the movie - settle back and expect a "student" movie from some high School college. This movie although good in concept fails. I would like some production house to take it on board - create the situation with some convinving special effects (to help the storyline), better sound, widescreen and convincing props. It could have been a brilliant movie but is spoiled by bad quality and unconvinving props. 
I was just gonna watch the film because I think RObert De Niro is one of the Greatest Actors Ever, but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of Being Black truly adds another factor to this film.it's a trip out film 
With the exception of disc# 6 this collection was very disappointing. It was obvious that the show lost its charm after season #3 and was well on its way out before Paul Reubens little incident. However, if you liked Pee-Wee Herman the first collection under Playhouse#1 is excellent. It was fresh and innovative. My 3 year old loves the first 6 discs. Disc #7 to disc #10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase. They should have included disc #6 with the first set. Anything after that was simply not entertaining. The quality of all the discs still is excellent. 
Did anyone else watch the same movie that I did? Or should I say try to watch the same movie that I did? I am a huge classic sci-fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one. I was mislead. I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie. In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past. The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring. The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing. It's not funny - it is embarassing. I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage 
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known Hollywood cliche in film making.I applaud the effort.the chicks in this Film are Happening Babes Fo SHO.but there ain't much to the Film but it has some fun to it 
Unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds, this DVD is otherwise a waste of money. Spend the extra money and buy "the Life of Birds" 
the dvd set is a good one, who cares if its edited, your still getting a good first season of roseanne. and you get commentary and behind the scenes stuff as well.if your not a fan dont buy it. and if you are a fan and you are tired of waiting for it to come on television, than definitely buy it 
I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter. I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that. It is more like a music video than a story. The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much. Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it. I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that. Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy. I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were. 
I enjoyed the first season and got it. Eagerly awaiting season 2. See it for sale overseas in the UK but not here? Tough waiting so long...sigh. I can do other formats besides North America but it's a pain. C'mon guys, I'd rather spend the money here. 
Awesome extras!!!! not to mention the show is awesome!!! Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole season! It was great to watch it again 
I agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say Baby Einstein videos, however, I still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay. My two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although I agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland. I love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the DVD. My son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days. The video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development. Hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing. 
I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife. Here are my gut impressions: First, very little is true to the book. That's not really a gut impression. That's the impression I got hearing my wife say "That's not in the book...that's not in the book..." Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling. It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie. I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching. You get to see... A kid chasing a ticket through a train, A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train, A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train, (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!) OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have... A train sliding out of control on the ice, A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice, A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the "coaster tycoon" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole. Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have... A train car running out of control through Santa's village, Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then... Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf. Ho ho ho. At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out! It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion. You know it's awful but you can't look away! And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this. It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up. My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't. So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume. Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit. Whatever a "character driven" story is, this is the opposite. Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little. I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids. 
A great behind-the-scenes look at decisions that shaped history - and nearly killed all of us. Cross-reference this with the more recent Kennedy biographies for a wider, sobering context. This is the sort of thing that the Bush Administration should have watched before deciding to invade Iraq. 
If you're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill, this is NOT the video for you. However, if you want a training video on big wave surfing, go ahead. A better video for the stoke would be the classic Endless summer 2. Much more of a better buy. Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it. I had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing. Nice documentary for Discovery Channel, not for the wired surf enthusiast. So 
Funniest movie I've ever watched.I think I busted a rib laughing. 
Of course the Criterion Collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer. The problem is the film itself. Preston Sturges made some genuinely profound films such as The Lady Eve, Unfaithfully Yours, and Hail the Conquering Hero that are rich and complex experiences. But Sullivan's Travels is simplistic, pretentious, and false. As the film's characters themselves point out, poverty is only intersting to the rich, whose view of it is distorted. Odd-faced character actors in dingy sets make a rich man's view of poverty and not at all related to the real thing. Sturges was one of the most highly-paid men in America, so his view of the subject matter is (like characters say in the film) based on cliche. The climax with its chain-gang laughing at a cartoon, is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy. Sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine self-deception, angry love, role playing and a host of other themes--in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambigous areas of human life that "serious" drama cannot so easily reach. This film is exactly the kind of film that Sullivan wants to make--which is why it is so overearnest and uninteresting. If you want to see the genious of Preston Sturges, watch any of his other films (even Harold Diddlebock) in their entirety. After the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over Sullivan's Travels that make makes it a dispiriting film. 
Warning! This is not for children. Seeing death, real destruction, and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9/11 is not for the young. With that being said, this is the real deal, what you probably didn't see on the nightly news. Great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of New York City that fateful day. If you never want to forget what happened The Day that Changed America, you must have this dvd. 
a solid addition to the rockumentary genre. this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars. looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career (and arguably he was solo with the police). at the time of this movie, it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting. the music is super, the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness 
Released during the Just Say No 1980s, this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse. Lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world, to make a little money. He soon impresses a big wheel who moves Lenny and his wife to California where they are at first overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it. Lenny continues to buy, buy, buy until it all crashes down. When the money stops rolling in, he is introduced to cocaine and the story then takes a dramatic turn as we watch Lenny lose it all. James Woods is fabulous as Lenny. I've seen this movie many times and now that I'm writing about it, I think it's time to pop this one into the VCR for another viewing 
I have to say, it took me a while to getting around to seeing this. I thought "Silence Of The Lambs" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of it was....good. But that was about it, as far as I was concerned. It just didn't really click with me, and it wasn't anything near the great movie I'd been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released. A bit surprisingly though, I thought "Hannibal" was really great once I finally did see it. Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than "Silence..." (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally. But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion. Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don't like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster. The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter. It seems like "Hannibal" has changed tract from "Silence" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves. Whether that's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who's even more evil than he is. Hannibal Lecter himself is, well, he's not a 'good guy' in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey. His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he's much more interesting as a character this time around. Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who's somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that's what so intrigued him in the first place. One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness. A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended). Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who's constantly at odds with Starling. A very, very engaging and wel-made movie 
I bought this DVD based on the review of it on the DVD Drive in web site. Either the person who reviewed it has never seen an exploitation movie before, or was not old enough to view one in the first place. He made it sound like the most graphic and disturbing prison movie ever. You would have thought it compared to the 'Ilsa' movies the way this guy went on about it. I'm not sure what movie he saw, but it wasn't this one. When the most extreme scene in the movie involves a person being shot at falling over bloodlessly like an old western, you have to wonder why exactly it merited an "unrated" version. I guess it's worth it if you want to see naked women dancing around in a circle, but it you want to see a gritty violent movie, buy something else 
This is a "goody-goody" Ronald Reagan propaganda style film. By that I mean that it tries to portray the US as the good guys being hit by the bad ones. It doesn't say what dirty role the US CIA had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis Islam, how it set up, equipped and nurtured not only Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda, but a whole bunch of other loathsome Islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe - like the Islamic Brotherhood and the Taliban for instance: all just to defeat the USSR, and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions, to fuel the greedy American consumerist lifestyle which US citizens take so much for granted. I am not a "conspiracy theorist"; these people are usually an absurd breed, going off at the other extreme tangent. I live in Peshawar, the hotbed of CIA mischief in the 1980s and 90s (and even now), and the area where I live - the University Town - housed all the actors on this stage: the US officials and spies, their clubs, the Afghan "Mujahideen" leaders' houses, etc. etc... I grew up seeing all this going on literally next door, and so would like to apprise my American friends of the unpleasant truth. The National Geographic and the Reader's Digest magazines are two long established icons of US media culture that have served as the unofficial (and therefore hard to suspect) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous US propaganda drives... Never trust their political commentaries, although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice.. 
JULIE JOHNSON is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a New Jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship, longing for knowledge to change things. She considers herself stupid, sneaks Science magazines to read when her overbearing husband isn't around, and finally gathers the courage (while staring at the stars one night) to change her plight. She takes a computer course, passes her GED and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life. Along the way she discovers other secrets about herself, buried in the facade of a life she has led. She changes, relates to the world in a different way, and refuses to settle for returning to 'the old life' when her husband returns promising her change. Her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels, but in the end this friendship cannot last, as her girlfriend doesn't have the same goals. The story is simple, but in the hands of the writers Wendy Hammond and Bob Gosse and with Gosse's fine direction, the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe. Lili Taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend Courtney Love gives a bravura performance. The remainder of the cast (Spalding Gray, Noah Emmerich, Gideon Jacobs, Mischa Barton, et al) is likewise strong. But it is Taylor's film and she offers one of her most poignant performances of her career. A thoughtful, sensitive, engrossing film. Grady Harp, September 0 
I saw this movie for the first time, and I found out that it is very VERY violent. And I laughed at some good parts, but the scene where Amy hits the wildlife keeper on the head with a frying pan for trying to cut the baby geese's wing IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO SEE. I think that this movie should be taken off the market, but this type of film has no place in the lives of young children. 
This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes 
This movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, "So What?" Don't waste your money! 
I saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies I have seen during the last two years. Stupid, stupid and stupid. Ryan Reynolds becomes annoying. If you have brain, never watch this movi 
This DVD was better than I could have asked for. It uses footage from the tv show This Week In Baseball [TWIB], and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of America's Pastime. It goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including Tim Hudson, Ryan Dempster, select Phillies players, many others, as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as Tommy Lasorda and Yogi Berra. If you love TWIB's "How 'Bout That" section of the show, you will adore this DVD. As far as I can tell, every major league team is shown, though some have the spotlight on them more than others. This is a must have for any baseball fan. It's by far one of the best MLB DVDs released in a long time. 
I recently saw Les Miserables - 10th Anniversary Concert on DVD and absolutely fell in love with it so I thought I would try something similar and decided to give Candide try. Boy, was I disappointed. I can't get past the first 30 minutes -- all these silly gimmicky "jokes" that are not even remotely funny. The singing is not bad (this cast has better technical control of their voices compared to the cast in Les Miz) but the choreography is trite and unimaginative, and the acting so juvenille that you'd think the characters are retarded. When the narrator fired his gun and a "bang" flag shot out from the gun instead -- that was over the top for me.... Yuck. 
His words to the jury, a petition for strength for them against great odds, for himself against greater odds, for a system sometimes blind to justice, and for the victim of negligence who has no voice, puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'The Verdict.' TV bytes and news reports of lawyers' greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best. And the courage and brilliance of "Brown v. Board" and "Heart of Atlanta" exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past. But once in while a movie ('Mockingbird') comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession: to do what is right, or even better, to do what is right against great odds. Frank Galvin, drunk, ambulance chaser, liar, failure, had that dream once but a mistake, an error of judgemnt, a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now, sucking on breath mints and bourbon, handing out cards, working for booze money. His old friend Jack Warden handed him a case, a no-brainer, a lovely Irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead. The Defendants? A squeaky clean, Chaired, lauded, published and handsome OBGYN and . . . . the Diocese of Boston. And Frank's going to cave. Hell. It's the eve of trial and he's been drunk through the 24 months of discovery. And then he prepares for the Settlement Conference with the Dfense Lawyer, James Mason (just positively brilliant) and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos. But a funny thing happens. Lke Marcellus (Burton) winning the Robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first AA meeting, Frank's not sure but something's different. And he begins to wonder if maybe this time he won't cave. Great, morbid, wry, ironic, gallows humor. Warden says after the Settlement Conference, "whadja' think of (Mason)?" Galvin: He's good. Warden: Good? He's the [. . . . .] Prince of Darkness. A cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief. I don't know that there is a better trial movie. People say that Newman lost but wasn't robbed for the Oscar because Ben Kingley was so wonderful in Ghandi. He was robbed. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury 
I didn't think of it much as a movie as I did a porn frenzy. I'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know Caligula was nuts. Otherwise, then I guess so was all of the Roman Empire. I simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy. It was stupid, simple and as soon as it was done I immediately threw it out. Not for the faint of heart. Not for the sophisticated either. Or anywhere in between. 
1. Make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something. 2. Have every scene take place in the dark. And your underworld must be lit by 15-watt bulbs. 3. Clothe everyone in black leather, particularly capes. This especially works for the villains, but in the interest of equal play the heroes can be edgy and wear black leather too. If they're villains, shave their heads. Give them sunglasses (for the dark!) 4. Copying Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil, throw something retro like brimmed fedoras into the wardrobe. 5. Have a premise where our hero, a lone, semi-geeky guy, wakes up or somehow finds himself in a world he does not remember getting into. He must clear his name of something, even if it's just getting off Pottery Barn's mailing list. 6. Have a Mysterious Woman who may or may not be in cohoots with the bad guys, but who falls in love with our hero and wants to save him by the end of act II. 7. Make damn sure she's sultry. Though blondes are generally more popular these days in Hollywood, here dark brunettes work best. 8. Have lots of issues that revolve around our brains being dicked with. Throw in lots of tortured dialogue about alternative consciousnesses/universes/fuel supplies/sugar substitutes. 9. This is very important: USE THE RHETORICAL LINE AT LEAST ONCE: "DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU [find the Kiber Crystal/try to rescue your love-interest/defy Dr. Morphface/turn on a bright light]?" Indeed he (and we) don't. This is supposed to get us all scared and anxious. 10. Our hero should have had, if possible, a happy childhood that turned tragic. Slaughtered parents work great here. Of course, he doesn't remember any of it, at least at first. 11. Populate your world with lots of machines with tubes, wires, cables, and ducts. There also should be flashes of lightning that serve no purpose. 12. Make sure your sets and costumes were "derived" from some black and white classic film from the 20s or 30s--Metropolis, Caligari, even Frankenstein will do nicely. This is both to show you have a "legitimate pedigree" and to cover up the fact that you have no original ideas yourself. 13. Make sure all the bad guys bite off their dialogue and sound mean. This is how we know they are bad guys, since lately both sides have been wearing black leather. 14. The guy gets the girl in the end and the sun comes out. Really now, do we have to say this??? (However, through most of the movie we must believe the love will be unrequited. The dame should have a troubled history, though you must keep it vague.) 15. Throw in some cyborgs. You gotta have cyborgs. 16. Have sets that are about fifteen times larger than they need to be, but which are largely empty. 17. There's always the authority figure who starts out in pursuit of our guy, but who by the end becomes convinced of his innocence and moves to his side. 18. There was some vague, recent apocalyptic event that destroyed most of civilization. But be brief here. Our audience may get to wondering how one guy saving one girl will restore all of civilization, and you don't want them thinking about that. 19. Include a sadomasochistic scene or two. The current favorite is to strap the victim spread-eagled on a rotating mechanical device and stick him with needles. This movie likes to stick them through the bone at the front of the skull, a really stupid place to insert a needle (but then, this screenwriter clearly isn't a brain surgeon). 20. Always have a big shoot-em-up climax with lots of explosions, steam, smoke, distorting of the picture with computer tricks, and loud rock music. This is how we resolve things when we have no idea what the hell we're talking about or how to end the movie. We hope nobody notices. Generally they don't. Follow this primer, and whatever you come up with will be called bold and visionary by people whose filmgoing history doesn't extend before 1995, and Roger "I don't wanna become critically irrelevant" Ebert 
I thought Beavis and Butthead changed America. Their stupidity was a influence of a generation. I, sadly, was not allowed to watch the show when it was on TV (I was a child and in my elementary school years at the time), and because I actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode (just like the duo themselves, they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and I don't care for music videos), I really love the show. However, like other people who also liked the show, I have to agree with them to release all of the episodes (for goodness sake! I can't believe they didn't put in the Customers Suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one I have ever seen when the show was on TV) because we want to see and have all of the episodes, not just 80% of them and never get to see the other ones. I guess this is still recommended but remember, we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back (even if they have a lost episodes collection I don't care, the people want them and Mike Judge is refusing to give us them! 
This is a movie you'll want to watch over again--a number of times for a number of reasons. For one, you'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go-round (perhaps the second and third go-round, too, and even beyond). As the legend goes, with the exception of a few brief, well-timed breathers, director Howard Hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film's sleek 92 minutes, with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once. I agree with the Amazon review: you'll also want to give the movie at least one look devoted exclusively to Cary Grant's performance as master-manipulator news chief Walter Burns. One can only marvel at his hair-trigger, incendiary reactions to each situational development. The big scoop involves the politically-driven gallows sentence of a meek little "anarchist" (John Qualen) alleged to have killed a black cop, and while ferociously tracking the story, Burns chats up and tries to reclaim his ace reporter, Hildy Johnson. The movie is based on Hecht and MacArthur's long-running Broadway hit The Front Page. An early talk-era version had been produced already for the silver screen, but Hawks decided his inspired idea of switching Hildy's gender to that of a woman justified another remake. He was right: of the various stage and film renditions, His Girl Friday is regarded as the most powerful and effective use of the source material. Handed this basic premise, scriptwriter Charles Lederer added one last layer of complexity: Hildy Johnson is not just any woman, but Walter Burns's ex-wife. As the action begins, she is bidding the chaotic, cynical, wise-cracking reporter's life farewell, having decided to settle down and marry an insurance man named Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy, perfect as the earnest, slow-witted foil to Grant). On hearing this, Burns hatches his plot. If he can pull off the entire stunt, he will beat the competition to a story on local corruption. By getting Hildy involved again, and helping her realize the Hawksian principle that "you are what you do," he will also regain a writer of rare talent. These two goals alone would be enough to keep his motivation interesting. But of course the chance to win back his ex-wife brings a sexy tension to the frantic, lunatic action. The one thing you have to do is reserve a viewing strictly for watching Rosalind Russell as Hildy. In the part that literally no one wanted (Jean Arthur, Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne and Carole Lombard all turned it down), Russell succeeds in making His Girl Friday her movie. Among her colleagues in the press room (played by a sterling ensemble of character actors), she's got the hard-nosed wit to sound right at home with the boys. At the same time, she stands out--not just in her bold pinstriped outfits, but with her unflagging dedication to the raw, key-punching grind of the professional "news man." When necessary she dashes from telephone to telephone, one raging conversation to the next, yet in the movie's moment of high pathos, she manages to be absoltuely riveting while barely raising her voice above a whisper. Finally, of course, her kinetic scenes with Grant are what earn this movie its reputation as one of the fastest, funniest zingers ever produced. My sole warning: fork over the dough for Columbia's authorized release. The cheap-o's--and there are several on the market--are pretty shabby in terms of image and sound quality. With so much re-watching in your future, do what it takes to get the best version 
Happiness can be delicate. In just one swoop, it can stolen out from under you, just when you least expect it. The results can be often devastating - some can never recover. The family in the Italian film The Son's Room has found such happiness, but when tragedy suddenly strikes, they're engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache. Grief is perhaps the most tangled of human emotions, and the vagaries of sadness, love, and anger that comprise its essence are often very difficult to portray. Luckily, co-writer, director, and actor Nanni Moretti avoids all the usual clichs in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film. The Son's Room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them. Moretti stars as Giovanni, a successful psychiatrist with a busy practice treating the assorted neurotics of the picture-perfect Northern Italian coastal town he and his family call home. Giovanni is a mild-mannered and kindly man, who has a sort of passive and submissive approach to living. Giovanni also has a lovely family: he's happily married to gorgeous book publisher Paola (Laura Morante) and shares what he considers a close relationship with his teenaged daughter Irene (Jasmine Trinca) and son Andrea (Giuseppe Sanfelice). He presides over his wife and two children with a kind of flaccid authority, enveloping them with the same deceptively passive doctoral concern with which he counsels his psychiatric patients. He supports, and heals, less by what he says than by what he doesn't say. He quietly coaches Andrea in soccer moves, while encouraging Irene to be more competitive at basketball. Perhaps it's an ominous portent of what is to come, but the film opens as Andrea and his friends have been accused of stealing a valuable fossil from the school's Science department. Giovanni and Paola are surprised to find they entertaining the idea that their son may in fact be guilty as charged. However, no one takes the incident that seriously. If this is the only drama that affects Giovanni's serene life, nothing prepares him for the sudden tragedy that occurs one sunny Sunday afternoon. Called away from home by a desperate client, Giovanni cancels his plans to go jogging with Andrea; and it's a fatal choice that haunts him for months to come. The accident, when it happens, is so unexpected. The loss giving rise to sorrow, rage, tenderness, and the inexplicable feeling that hope is no longer possible. The family, emotionally fractured, is unable to continue on. Plunged into unimaginable grief, Giovanni attempts to carry on with his life, but bereft of his objectivity, he finds he's no longer able to function as an analyst. The Son's Room, with it's subtle acting and its pensive, emotionally layered story, remains a startling testament to the delicate nuances of grief. And it's as though Moretti has invited the viewer to spy on a deeply personal event in the life of a very ordinary family. Like a fly on the wall we witness the sadness, the regret, the empty dinners and the overwhelming feeling of whether they could have done anything to stop the accident. Moretti, whose eyes glitter with knowledge from within a bland, bearded, professorial face, gives a wonderful performance, as does the classy Morente as the beautiful, anguished Paola. While Giovanni wanders dazed through a theme park, numb to the grief, Paola fields a desire to talk about the absent child. A savior for the family arrives in a letter addressed to the deceased, and when the writer appears on the family's doorstep, she offers the grace note that reminds them of the means by which happiness eventually repairs itself and the unavoidable fact that life goes on. There's no catharsis here, only a heartfelt exploration of what it means to grieve. Mike Leonard August 05. 
I find this to be a perfect depiction of small town life being I lived for 11 years in a town quite like this one. Really enjoyed the movie and the acting. I enjoyed most Terry Moore's potrayal of Betty 
This DVD provides Benoit's life story, which I found very interesting. I believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection, but it was still pretty great. Pegasus Kid VS Jushin "Thunder" Liger- This is the type of wrestling I love. Plenty of chain wrestling, huge Japanese crowd meaning a very quiet yet applaud filled match. This match is where Chris Benoit became a huge star in Japan. Benoit puts on a great match with a Japanese legend. 8.5/10 Wild Pegasus VS The Great Sasuke- This was another match with plenty of chains, and some pretty cool high flying stuff by both guys, but mainly Sasuke. Like the Liger match, this was a fast-paced and solid 20 minute match. 8.5/10 Wild Pegasus VS Black Tiger[Eddie Guerrero]- These two have had some far better matches, and this is one of those that I wished would have been replaced by something a little better. Still a solid match. 7/10 Chris Benoit VS Too Cold Scorpio[ECW]- These two have some nice chemistry together. Another 20 minute match ending just before the bell. 8/10 Chris Benoit VS Al Snow[ECW]- Many consider this to be a great match, but I just couldn't get into it. Slow-paced match until towards end. 6.5/10 Chris Benoit VS Kevin Sullivan[WCW Nitro]- This was an all out brawl, going all over the arena, including the bathrooms. Very impressive finish. 8/10 Chris Benoit VS Eddie Guerrero[WCW Nitro]- A very solid match with these two. Great chemistry together, Eddie and benoit show abilitiese we have not seen for awhile. 7.5/10 Chris Benoit VS Bret Hart[WCW Owen Hart Tribute Match]- This was a phenominal match. Bret is a true great, as is Benoit. You just don't see this sort of stuff nowadays. 9.5/10 Chris Benoit VS William Regal[Brian Pillman Tribute Show]-Weird lighting for this match, and not very active crowd. Besides that, Benoit and Regal put on a classic. 8/10 Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[RAW Steel Cage Match]-This match was amazing. Benoit and Angle are the finest chain wrestler in WWE today, and they put on a classic steel cage match. Stone Cold Steve Austin does guest commentary. 9/10 Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[Royal Rumble 2003 WWE Title Match]- Benoit and Angle put on another classic in the main-event of the Royal Rumble. Just a truly fantasic match with plenty of false finished, submissions and high-impact moves. 10/10 Chris Benoit VS Shawn Michaels VS Triple H[Wrestlemania XX World Title Match]- This is my all time favorite match. The main-event for Wrestlemania XX is often called the best Wrestlemania main-event ever, and it isn't surprising. A long, bloody match with pedigrees, sweet chin musics, sharpshooters, crossfaces, diving headbutts, and breaking tables. 10/10 This is a must-have for anyone who enjoys watching a good match. Benoit is one of the best performers in the business, and this is his story. I reccomend to all 
Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned. I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong. But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't. By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah.... The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place. But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break. Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine. Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals. Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came???? Want more? In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess??? In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out). First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown. We have none of that here. Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes. Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least. But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth. Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end. What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk! Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!" Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great. 
BEST MEN surprised me very much; I wasn't expecting such a delightful, if a little bit depressing, movie. Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot. Luke Wilson plays Jesse, a convict getting out of prison after a theft, and who is getting married to his sweetheart, Hope (Drew Barrymore). Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson's lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks. Billy doesn't tell his buddies that he's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding, but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff (Fred Ward) who also happens to be Billy's father! Soon, the inevitably nasty FBI comes in, headed by the sadistic and cold agent, played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable Raymond J. Barry (Dead Man Walking, The Chamber). The movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale. This dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest. Brad Dourif gives one of his best performances since "Cuckoo's Nest" as the mentally challenged Vietnam vet. Fred Ward, Dean Cain, Sean Patrick Flannery and Mitchell Whitfield are also excellent. It's the best work I've seen Cain do. The movie entertained me immensely, and I would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy! Or is it a comic drama? Cheers 
My 2 and 3 year old boys really enjoyed this DVD. This Backyardigans DVD is their favorite so far (they have the 2 others Snow Fort and It's Great to be a Ghost also). The music is lively but not loud and obnoxious like some kid's videos. It introduces kids to different styles of music and has great characters whose behaviors you don't mind your children copying. The Backyardigans are one of my favorite shows for them to watch. 
Using the G8 Summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed (at least to me) like a recipe for disaster, but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by Bill Nighy, The Girl in the Cafe is an unexpected gem. Don't miss it. 
This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other. When does that ever happen? The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids. What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."? I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense. I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie. 
Hey Pizanos! It's the Super Mario Bros Super show! Sound familiar to you? If it does, great! That just means that your ready for season two of The Super Mario Bros Super show. Mario, Luigi, and Toad are back to save Princess Toadstool and themselves out of the evil King Koopa's hands. There are all of the remaining episodes on this disc except for four. I understand that Shout faught Dic for the remaining four with no success. Go figure. Oh well. You atleast get to see the other episodes on all of these discs with no audio problems as mentioned for season one. There are also special features on all four DVD's to play around with. Want to look at the outline for how the idea for the set came about? Take a basement tour! See how the creators met Lou Albano, plus more! Everybody get ready to do the Mario and go back to your child hood and watch the good guys win and triaumph over the evil forces of King Bowser Koopa. 
I first saw this movie in high school in the theater. I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now. So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence. I understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing, given that she only appears in a very few scenes. Well, that's the way of the world - it's marketing right or wrong, and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known. It's not right, but that's Hollywood. I mean, better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all, yes? And you've got to admit, it was quite a debut for Ben Kingsly. Wow. He'll be forever known for this role. That aside, this is an excellent, amazing film. Of course, it's still highly relevant, perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear. The movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration. A must-see for anyone who feels anger, fear, agressively nationalistic, hopelessness, hatred, or lost. I can think of several politicans who need to see this movie 
I glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is "intellectual" because it is made anywhere but the USA. In their eyes America can do no right. My other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame. 
Poor Lindsay Lohan - it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life, she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off. As an actress, she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft. As a child actress, she was a natural fit for her spate of Disney appearances, with FREAKY FRIDAY her crowning achievment. However, as a young adult, the pressure is much higher, as is the bar of success. And movies like this are NOT helping. But to be fair, one cannot place the blame on Ms. Lohan. The fact is, she has already had a turn in a non-Disney role which paid off exquisitely. MEAN GIRLS offered us the first glimpse of Lindsay in a post-Disney world. The timing was on, the interaction with the cast was superb, and everything just fell into place. But then again, that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer (Tina Fey). JUST MY LUCK has NONE of these things going for it. Perhaps ironically, Ms. Lohan's latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her. We have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck. Lohan is lucky, Chris Pine is not. Inevitably through the courses of movie magic, we know that the two will end up trading places (much like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd once did in . . . what was the name of that movie again?) The only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old Asian or a wise old Gypsy. (Spoiler - it's the gypsy! OK, I know, I shouldn't be giving these things away!) Like I said, we all know this is going to happen. What we DIDN'T know was that it was going to take THIRTY-FIVE minutes to get there! So, we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of Lohan's good luck and Pine's bad luck. By the time they make the switch, I had already lost interest and was planning my lunch. After the predictable bout of sudden bad luck, Lohan learns that an ill-timed kiss with Mr. Pine was what caused the change of fortune. Problem is, the kiss was at a masquerade party, and she doesn't know whom she kissed. What follows is perhaps the film's only somewhat enjoyable sequence as Lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back. Sadly, this brief bright spot ends too quickly, and it is back to the formula as Lohan and Pine meet and fall in love anyway, not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other's luck to change. If predictable hook-ups make you happy, you might find some charm in this final third of the film - that is if you can overlook the sudden need for Lohan's best friend to become a song-writer in what was obviously a "what do we do with the final act?" tacked-on storyline with positively no set-up beforehand. The problem with this film is that it comes across as very "slapped-together" (To borrow from Mad TV, it was "JUST MADE IN TEN DAYS). Is the director to blame? While Donald Petrie has a few hits to his name (MISS CONGENIALTY, GRUMPY OLD MEN, and MYSTIC PIZZA) he also has more than a few duds (THE ASSOCIATE, WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN). Or perhaps it is the writing team? To date, the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit, and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that Ms. Lohan does in fact possess. Personally, I would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make Lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is. Her character comes off as too nice to hate, and yet too shallow to root for. Whoever is to blame, this is clearly a sub-par effort at best, and one I hope Lindsay (or her casting agent) will learn from. With four movies coming down the pike, she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career. I like that she has taken smaller ensemble roles recently (such as PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION and BOBBY). A very smart play on her part. Let's hope she can steer clear of JUST MY LUCK roles for awhile 
I really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc. I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length. The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film kids! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well. I think the remake is incredible.....is it better than the original? In some ways yes! in some ways no! Thats the way it goes! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone's movie collection! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-) 
What can one add to what's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time? "Citizen Kane" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as "Kane" itself. It's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary "The Battle over Citizen Kane" and the HBO film "RKO 281." I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who have watched "Citizen Kane" once and thought it was just OK. But seeing it once is simply not enough. This is true of any great film, but more so for "Kane," a multifaceted work that cannot be fully digested upon first viewing. In many ways, "Kane" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it. Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry. Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast. The expertly produced documentary, "The Battle over Citizen Kane," recounts the factors that nearly prevented Welles' film from seeing the light of day. But it belabors the comparison between Welles and Hearst. Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter. By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles' career tanked after "Kane," the documentary glosses over Welles' achievements. Welles went on to make several great films, two of which ("Touch of Evil" and "Chimes at Midnight") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to "Kane." While the documentary overdoes the comparisons between Welles and Hearst, "RKO 281" distorts the relationship between Welles (Liev Schrieber) and "Kane" co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich). Mankiewicz was holed up with Welles' Mercury Theatre partner John Houseman - not Welles - at Victorville, and Houseman was Welles' confidant throughout the "Kane" controversy, not Mankiewicz. If the film simplifies real-life relationships, it remains an enjoyable - if somewhat lightweight - re-enactment of the controversy, with great performances by James Cromwell as the imperious Hearst and Melanie Griffith as the ditsy Marion Davies. Back to the inevitable question: is "Citizen Kane" the greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though "Touch of Evil" might be even better among Welles' own films. But "Kane" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. "Citizen Kane" has topped the highly regarded "Sight and Sound" polls since 1962, and the American Film Institute reinforced "Kane's" #1 status with its 1998 Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong? Watch "Citizen Kane" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself 
This movie was so stupid, everyone listens to Nina when she is clearly messing with their lives. They are stupid enough to believe her, and well I don't even know what else happens cause I saved myself and changed the channel 
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes. It gets stuck or restarts itself. Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
This movie makes me want to vomit. Watching Bio-Dome is physically painful to the overwhelming majority of people 
One of the worst films of a generation. Many talented comedic (Dave Thomas - Colleen Camp) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral. 
This show undoubtly is one of the greatest around. I have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give American's their own Monty Python show and they failed because their show is BETTER than Monty Python. Their show is not BETTER, it is of equal and noteworthy standing. Monty Python is history that will never been changed. They have gone on to do many other creative things. Bob Odenkirk is doing Miller Lite commercials and I hope he does something like David has with his new appearance in Arrested Development. I can honestly say that this show is not better, yet it is close, to Monty Pythons Flying Circus. Both are great shows. It is full of hillarious sketches and original ideas that is for sure and if you haven't yet, go buy the other seasons and add to your growing comedy sets because you won't regret adding this 
I am a yoga instructor and I bought this DVD hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students. This DVD is NOT a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title! What I did see was a woman who was very flexible, quite possibly a dancer, doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements. In most of the movements she taught, this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion. Pass this one up! 
This movie is so touching. I loved the determination of the girl. It's been a while since I've seen this movie so forgive me for not remembering the characters' names. My children got hooked on foreign films after watching this movie with me. A great family movie or just a clean chick flick 
I HAVE TO AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE REVIEWER: "MKSONIC50". I READ HIS REVIEW OF "PLAY IT AGAIN SAM" THE SCENE WHERE WOODY ALLEN TRIES TO BE COOL AND COMPOSED WHEN INTRODUCED TO A LADY AND HE, INSTEAD OF SOUNDING ANYTHING LIKE ENGLISH, ONLY GROWLS. I RECENTLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ALL I COULD THINK WAS OF THAT SCENE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. I HAVE TO REPEAT THAT: "MKSONIC50" IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. THAT WAS THE BEST COMICAL SCENE EVER. 
Good grief - yet another DVD collection we are not buying because Disney doesn't seem to understand. We LOVED these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete. I hope the folks at Disney get the message eventually. Same thing applies to their live action feature films. Disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother. Too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production 
Susan Ward,coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on TV, gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from AOL Films. Director Mary Lambert tries and fails to give us a Basic Instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures, it looks like Warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with. As the lack of film sets show. If you like Susan Ward, then give this a movie a try, if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future, DON"T FIND IT HERE 
I ordered these, and several other movies from the Tyler Perry Collection, only to find that they were not actual movies but on-stage plays. I returned them and was charged a high restocking fee. Not OK! No where in the description was mention of them being stage plays. I will order my CD's and DVD's from another source in the future. 
Unfortunately they just do not get off the ground. Python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge. Regrettably they missed the mark on this one. One or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it. However if you like sex, violence, blood, and debauchery, could care less the fact that they have nothing to do with the absent plot, you could find this film interesting. 
An intriging suspense film with a shocking ending. The clues are obvious throughout the film, but the viewer is, nevertheless, surprised and possibily amazed. Alan Rickman shines as David Weinburg, the social climbing husband. His performance shows his versality as an actor. For viewers who like suspense Dark Harbor is a must 
I love this movie. I can't go an entire day without watching it. One time i was in the audience of leno. Whenever the camera panned over us, i waved a copy of this pleasure in front of it while yelling about how funny this riot is. Ahh, funny i remember the part where that one guy has to itch his balls. Just thinking about it makes me tingle with anticipation!!! Rent this movie or you will not see it. Buy it or forever hold your peace 
First off I do not dislike Adam Sandler, I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film, not so much because I like raunchy antics, but because of the underlying message. Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this. You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting, farting etc, but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him, he is loyal to his fans and to his friends. Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey? No one else does, that's a good friend, also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich, evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films. He never sinks to there level either, perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy, deeply disturbing film, I cannot, in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies,what was he thinking? Early on in the film his character, a drunken loser, belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant " Ok I go take shower now" says Chinese waiter. I wanted to take a shower too, very soon after that scene. For starters Mr. Sandler seems to think he is a voice over man, he is not. His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard. One can barely understand he is trying to do a character, and he barely is. Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters, he is equally bad in each. Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house, he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something, he coaches the kids basketball team, he has been for years, and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him, he is simply there to be lovable, and put upon, he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face (as is the so-called humor here). The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end, there is no real motivation for his bazaar, cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them. He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures, a menorah and a Christmas thing, I forget what it was. He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one, but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence, he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink, I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads, surly, even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book. Not here. Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go. The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous, mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms. He goes to the basketball game and insults the children, ridiculing one boy for being fat, the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants "nice kitty kitty" he squeaks, what the???? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side (his only side) and is force fed a jock strap "I hope you like them extra sweaty" Ho Ho Ho. For the next part of the film which seems like eight days, crazy or otherwise, his house is burned, he pushes his benefactor down a hill, in a porta potty which freezes feces on him, he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him, on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth. We are treated to this twice. God bless us, every one. By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs, each worse then the last, fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad "If I move my bowls without using the spray....that's a technical foul" is one of few lines I remember, thank you God. By reading this one might assume, as I did, that this is irreverent in the good way, poking fun at old Christmas standards, but it is not. It is disgusting, badly written, annoying and very, very cruel. The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly, for no good reason with no motivation or payoff, the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand, this is not always a bad thing. Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk, a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah, he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after. The same cannot be said for the audience. Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate, who is the audience? There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place, the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness. Adam Sandler has been loyal to his friends, his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was, even if it hurt his feelings. This Christmas turkey won't even work as leftovers. Bah Humbug 
LIL ABNER is a delightful comedy-musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals. This film version of the Broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on DVD in a beautiful print with it's comic book coloring. It's also superbly cast. The film's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play Lil Abner and Daisy Mae - Peter Palmer (who starred in the Broadway show) and Leslie Parrish - but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles (it's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as Abner anyway, although Daisy Mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era). It's a shame neither Palmer or Parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years. Both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals, as the Dogpatch crowd might say. It's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable - notably "Jublian P. Cornpone", "A Typical Day in Dogpatch", and "Put 'em Back The Way They Was" which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young Valerie Harper ("Rhoda") and Beth Howland ("Alice") but most of the songs are good-humored and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original Broadway show. Jerry Lewis has a funny walk-on cameo and the gorgeous Julie Newmar and Stella Stevens have amusing secondary roles. Most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here, including Donna Douglas as the busty hillbilly girl (a few years before becoming famous as one on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) who wants "to broaden our horizons" and is informed by Mammy Yokum (superbly played by Billie Hayes) that she her horizons is broaden enough. There's quite a bit of political satire in here as well (with politicans with such apt names as Mayor Dogmeat and Senator Jack S. Phigbound) and the Sadie Hawkins Day sequence (a Dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it's own with many high schools for years having an annual "Sadie Hawkins Dance" in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered "acceptable") is a lot of fun. But then so is the movie. As a Yoakam says when they really mean it - "I Has Spoken!" 
Peter Sellers as well as Peter O'Toole and all the beautiful women: Capucine, Romy Schneider, etc, make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60's. Was really that world that mad? Of course! You couldn't stand life without a psychonalist. Thus, the film reflects precisey that. The lack of self-confidence, the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade, till -happy ending, of course- O'Toole and Schneider get married and lived happily everafter. And everybody has surpassed their personal crises. Good for the movie. The humour is just wonderful. I recommend it most enthusiasticall 
What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is "I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job." How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, "I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too." I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how "real" Furious was. "Young" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today. 
it seems like the actors didn't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot... overly timid and shy... captain wentworth isn't at all handsome or dashing... and when they finally get together at the end, it's so awkward, bland, and unclimactic you wished you'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book... some people might have liked it, but i definitely didn't. to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like, i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice. this movie could have been bette 
"Hello Vietnam,and greetings!",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. "You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. "Would Bob Dylan be out of line?",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,"Way,way,way out of line!". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls." Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,"You suck,eat a bag of s--t!". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,"Good morning,Vietnam",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,"Goodbye,Vietnam" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV? Obviously nobody had any ideas,not even Mitch Markowitz who composed the screenplay 
So-So story about a man's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star's mother. Like that old Dickie Roberts movie, it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars, but does not do a good job of it. Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple, where are you when we need you? 
I had no idea what I had missed. I bought this set at Sam's Club for $18 (now I see what a deal I really got). I watched every minute and loved it. If you haven't seen it...DO! And, maybe check out Sam's Club for your own copy at an incredible price 
I have seen other Pokemon movies, but this was the worst. The plot was bad and it did not have that many pokemon as I thought.And Mew does not fit in the story when it is about Lucario 
This is the sort of sequel that should have been made in the first place. The premise is sillier than the first film (which was pretty silly itself), but the characters are appealing and the action is streamlined and intense. Enjoy the ride and try to forget that "The Lost World" ever existed 
Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don't misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things. 
First let me say that I thought Angela's Ashes was an absolutely terrific book and Frank McCourt fully deserved his Pulitzer Prize. This movie was a horrendous let down. No one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty. Everything was a Hollywood version of suffering and misery, from Emily Watson's pretty red coat standing in for the real Angela's gray rag to the beautifully lit Irish streets and of course John "let me tell you how you're supposed to feel right now" Williams' cloying, inappropriate music. The acting from the children was great. They were absolutely the best part of the film. Of course, given the constraints of film and the average audience tolerance for unpleasantness such as oozing eyes, pimples and bad teeth all the kids were pleasing to look at, clear skinned and attractive. At least they could act! Emily Watson was given little to do. Robert Carlyle was good although Alan Parker seemed determined to sanitize the ambiguities of McCourt's father by only showing little episodes of drunkeness and thoughtlessness. Parker tends to be an extremely literal, by-the-numbers director with little understanding of subtlety (look what he did in the Pink Floyd's "The Wall"). This time he was clearly given a mandate by the Hollywood bigwig producers not to make the film too "depressing" or "grim" so that audiences would accept it. The film ends up being a choppy, gentrified, soulless version of one of the best modern books ever written. Really a shame and a waste of resources. 
This DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei. This DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE. Out of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two "big" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program. These two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written! According to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon's Temple. Leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the "sacred feminine" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often! Richard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are "bonkers," trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves. This LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus "FACT" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled "FACT" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney! Margaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D. The documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the "secret" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don't believe it even exists. Sadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy. Overall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion. A much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and Jesus 
I found this series to be fun, gritty, and lifelike. The characters in the Precinct remind me so much of guys I used to work with on the job. Certainly some artistic license is taken, but for the most part, this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs. Denis Leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian, but a really talented character actor. His supporting cast fits well, and all in all I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of Rescue Me, or Denis Leary 
I was very disappointed in this DVD. It was a DVD for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds. The DVD was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details. The ability to view details of color and details of wing, tail bands, etc would have offered a much better learning tool. It also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations 
I could watch this over and over again! It's so funny! The person who dissed women's manly handshakes is a sexist! But anyway, I would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch! Definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too.....for one viewing per 5 months. Don't force it on them is my advice!! Rock o 
this is my vote for 3rd worst movie ever made. its dumb, theres no violence hardly, no blood and i actually got a headache from renee [now i look chinese] zelwack-broad screaming for 90minutes and watching how bad the acting is. this is like a drug that doesnt work and now i want my 3 dollars and 90minutes of my life back. 
Yes the movie is great but please tell me about the DVD ! How's the quality,are there deleted scene's ,any bonus material ? I think there are about 115 reviews about the movie but I would like more info about the DVD itself! I am from Georgia where the movie was filmed ....so I'm hoping for some deleted scene's ! Anyone who has the DVD,please give info! Thanks 
Then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else? The songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals, which arguably weren't that bad ("What a girl wants" and "Get this party started" were fairly tame to begin with). Just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds 
Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Coburn (and a "killer" soundtrack by Henry Mancini) deserve much better treatment than they get in this no-frills DVD with absolutely no special features. This comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest --in spite of a less than admirable film transfer. It's all thanks to the great performances, tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay. Hopefully a better quality and enhanced DVD version will replace this one in your film library. Nonetheless, "Charade" remains a charming and timeless classic 
Betty Hutton has a colossal amount of energy. She seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining. She's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers. Her voice is sturdy, durable, indestructible. But oh my God, her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film (whereas Buffalo Bill, allegedly a larger-than-life character, looks like a corpse by comparison, and Howard Keel, in only his second film, must manage to act like these are human beings he's relating to). Take a look at Betty Hutton's reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered "a bit much" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater. At best, her performance is clownlike; at worst, it's apelike. Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity. It's a magnificent effort, and a stunning testimony to her desire to please, but her comedy has no reality, no nuance, no connection to any sincere emotion. She seizes on "hick" and drives that into the ground, then she plays nothing but "infatuated" for a while before toggling to "resentful" and so forth ... It's a series of masks and set pieces, but it's not a character. Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life, but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie's rootin'-tootinest moments, and she wouldn't have neglected Annie's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes. Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy, and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character. Annie could be a wonderful character, a great self-conflicted mess of strength, longing, guts, femininity, skill, naivete and worldiness, all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop-eyed, crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet. I am surprised that Hutton didn't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out. Maybe they just wouldn't let her. The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh, oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide. I kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on, and the memory of Betty Hutton's performance is branded on my brain, but it's because this performance seems like it's following the traditions of some other culture, some other world. It's like going to a sideshow. That said, the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another, in wildly different styles, with effective melodies worth remembering. The classic tunes just keep coming. The movie works as spectacle and songfest, and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness. But if you're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations, you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes. 
What do we do When first started watching wrestling in my early teens, Ric Flair was a hero of mine, he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever. So when this DVD came out I got it immediately, hoping to relive my youth, but I realized something. All the matches are the same, there long and dull, the same moves are done over and over, and the matches only pick up when Flair opponent takes the advantage. There is nothing wrong with long matches, if that are done well, like the Iron man match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long, so it can show Flairs endurance. I also noticed Flair is so repetitive, all wrestler use trademark moves, but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life, for example, chop...woo...flair flop...figure four...cheat....win, that not a description of one flair match, that's every flair match. When I started watching wrestling I only saw his WWF matches, so it all looked new to me, when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are. Other wrestler have put together DVD, which shows a variety of different matches such as Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benito, Bret Hart Shawn Michaels, all top wrestler adopt to there opponents, Flair expects his opponents to adopt to him, that's way all his matches are the same. The only thing worst then his DVD is his book, I lost all respect for Flair after a read his book, it seem that he is just like HHH and Shawn Michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face, put does it behind their backs. He bashes Mick Foley for being a stunt man, who only does gimmick matches, so what's HHH, a guy flair calls great, can anyone name a good HHH match that isn't a gimmick match (WM X-7 against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight). He says Foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player, who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles. He critises Bret Hart for not putting over Shawn Michaels at Survivors Series 97, when he was called upon to job to Lex Luger before he left who the WWF. he refused and took the title with him to WWF, brining the WCW to its knees. After watching this DVD, reading his book, and seeing how his using backstage politics at the WWE now, to keep himself in the limelight, its fair to say the Ric Flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way I could have won 16 world title if I had my friends booking the show . 
Martin Short joins the cast in this volume, securing this show's enduring genius and originality. The cast, brilliant as always, never fail to deliver. I grew up watching this show--- and what a thrill to have it on DVD. I feel like they have finally come home!!! woo hoo!! 
Well, This dvd is pretty bad, like everyone else said. It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window. I really highly recommend renting this before you buy it, cause otherwise you are wasting your money 
We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new. They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense. I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
If you like Murder-Mysteries; you might like this. Attractive leads perform an average script. Technically, good costumes, good lighting, attractive sets. The story holds your attention. The detective is interesting, and his sleuthing has some interest. If you like a light Whodunnit; you may like this. As good as anything on TV today. I rated this 2-stars, compared to "Road to Avonlea, Third season" mystery episode with Christopher Reeve, which I rate 4-stars. Not as clever as the TV show "Columbo"; but the period setting may make up for this. This did not have what I was looking for, some adventure, more believability, more charm, and more cleverness. The sets are attractively "staged"; rather than sets that take you there. Has pleasant characters; but not deep. Some good humor personality with the servants. The appeal is for one who likes a light, Whodunnit detective film, in a period setting; without my great expectations. I remember "Young Sherlock Holmes" as better; though I saw it a long time ago. 
My kids just love this movie; Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses. It is a very clean movie. It is not scary except for the mean Duchess; but she really isn't scary, just mean. It teaches about honesty and family, and how they care about each other; which is really good for children to see. Plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch 
I was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized. And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over. Imagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing "All though the Year" from _Elmo Saves Christmas" among others). The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage. If you don't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars. If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity. Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative 
This movie sounded stupid when I first heard about it. Who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense? Obviously, Ice Cube could. This movie stars LisaRaye in her film debut as Diana, who is known to the stripping world as Diamond, a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school. While working at a shoe store, she meets Trixie (Adele Givens) and Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson). They convince her into quitting her low-paying job and working at The Player's Club, a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac). When Diana's cousin Ebony (Monica Calhoun) comes into town, she tells Diana that she wants to work at the player's club. Ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of "using what you've got to get what you want". This movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie. Featured in the movie are Jamix Foxx, A.J. Johnson, and John Amos. The plot is perfect and the script is well written. This movie has to be one of my favorite 
Many of these shorts on this DVD (as well as the other DVD's in this series) have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these DVD's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you'll see on the cartoons 
I watched this movie in health class during a unit on ageing. The movies was very touching, and turned the whole class to tears. But, it was a great movie that was very touching, and I would suggest watching it 
I myself am a huge Buffy/Angel fan, I had read the reviews here and I thought it was worth a shot seeing it. Well The script was terrible, the story even worse, direction - don't get me started. One reviewer said it, it was like they didn't know whose point of view to choose. The soundtrack was awful. The ending was sooo stupid. did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them... they just keep standing there. Like nothing is happening. I really haven't seen a movie this bad in... well... EVER!! Oh and Alyson Hannigan's acting was way better in My stepmother is an alien. I think she was about 13 in that role. Don't get me wrong she's a extremely talented actress... I blame it on the script. rent it, don't buy it. You'll be embarassed to own it. I am 
I have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding Robert Kennedy, and I've got to say that this is, by far, one of the best pieces of work I've yet to see. The movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience's attention, allows for us to actually *feel* what Robert Kennedy is feeling, to sense the tension during chaotic times, and most importantly, to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for America. This movie is extremely well-balanced, provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of Robert Kennedy, and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from Kennedy's life. If you are looking to pick one movie on Robert Kennedy - this is it. This is THE one you want to watch. After watching this, you will see Robert Kennedy in a way you never have before. 
This DVD was a really good buy, even if you are just somewhat into Incubus, but if you are a big fan, it's a must have. The home videos and tour of the tour bus and all the music videos and concert footage was great, with great sound quality. Also, there is a really funny Take Me To Your Leader music video. It's a really cool DVD. The only thing i didn't like, was the "Massive Song Archive" the background music was kind of annoying, and you cant just sit and watch through the whole thing, you have to click on different things. But good buy anyways. INCUBUS ROX 
I ordered this after seeing Peggy on PBS doing yoga with a 97 year old woman. I've got some lung problems and was looking for something low impact that I could do to help build my capacity. The DVD is great and easy to follow. Peggy breaks the session down into three parts of twenty minutes, so you can do an hour or less as your schedule indicates. Best of all, you work from a chair, so this is truly adaptable to any age and fitness level 
While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church. Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain 
Unless you enjoy movies that are not funny, not scary, and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns, DO NOT WATCH this series of horrible flicks. Putrid! Not even "so-bad-it's-funny". Absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind! Heed my warning! SUCKS!! 
Cheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today. They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age! What other band sounds better 30 years later? After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly. Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out. And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song. However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song. NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY. It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show. The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc. The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs. That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show. Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety. Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD. Update 6/14/05: Exactly a year later, I've still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick's still my favorite band. 
Having watched great movies in the Bible series such as Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Samson and Delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures, I was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film. What a let down by this anachronism. How low can one go! This is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of God. If you do not believe in God, have never read the Bible, particularly Genesis but have heard of Noah from hearsay, perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value, a mediocre one at that. If you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of Noah's ArK, don't aggravate yourself. Avoid this movie like a plague. 
Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. However, I have been pleasantly surprised. Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including "12 Dancing Princesses," was significantly higher than I had expected. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music. On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or The Queen of the Night's aria from Mozart's magic flute, and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. ("Magic of Pegasus" and "Mermaidia" respectively.) The soundtrack to "Twelve Dancing Princesses" is mostly adapted from some of Mendelsohn's best work, including "A Midsummer night's dream" and the Scottish and Italian symphonies. It also includes a lullaby sung to the King by the 12 princesses which was based on a 16th century anthem by Byrd, the recording of which was sung beautifully by Melissa Lyons and the Women's Occidental Glee club. The story is loosely based on the children's story. "Barbie" plays "Princess Genevieve", the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed King (e.g. seven young women, plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6.) Like the original, the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing, sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night. However, in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the King their father, who loves them very much, but his cousin, Duchess Rowena, who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor. At first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was ... As with many of the Barbie films, comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters. In this case Princess Genevieve has a pet cat, and the evil Duchess Rowena has an equally evil pet monkey, Brutus. The hero, who in this version is the royal cobbler, Derek, has a pet parrot, who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated Indian accent. (That's Indian from the subcontinent, not native American.) Those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them. And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality, but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is, that is a concern with this film. But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. Alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring. And best of all, the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it's own 
I was under the impression that this was the entire series. I finally, after many issues, got my set and unwrapped it, and my heart sank audibly when I saw "Complete Collection I". I popped the last disk in and lo and behold, it wasn't the full series afterall. 
Okay,the only real extras on the DVD is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it's stars,but Warner Bros. gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of BOTH Standard Full Frame and Widescreen versions on one disc!!! This movie is an absolute classic!!! And it's great to have it on DVD!!! One of the great "men in chains" films!!! The great cast includes Paul Newman,George Kennedy(in his oscar winning role!),Wayne Rogers,Strother Martin,Joe Don Baker,Ralph Waite,and many other classic character actors!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A 
A movie not geared for morons! What a rare find. There aren't many movies that can't be figured-out half way through. This film is great; very clever. Never saw the ending coming 
Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it. No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next. If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal. Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases. I have to wonder what they could be: "Damned Melon!" or "I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!"??? I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether. In sum, don't waste your time 
I love Asian movies. I like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days. 2047 however, was the first asian movie that I failed to finish becaase of the sheer BOREDOM of the plot. Don't get me wrong, the main actor (Clark Gable look-alike) is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous, but the movie itself IMO is overrated. You can argue "art" all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you(not my bag at all). I kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to realize..Oh my God it's not over! BORING 
This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films. It then tried to mix them all together in one film. The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead. Especially the Matrix. We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life. Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements. Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor. The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect. Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action. I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it. As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include. The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting. Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here
