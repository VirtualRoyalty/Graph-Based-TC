Graph-based framework for text classification

There are 3 python files for every dataset. Files ending with main.py contain tf and tf-idf, files ending with tf-icf.py contain tf-icf(term frequency-inverse collection frequency) and files ending with gow.py contain the tw, tw-idf and tw-icw methods.

In each file there are several parameters to set.
